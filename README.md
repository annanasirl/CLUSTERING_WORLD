The aim of this project is to compare different unsupervised learning techniques on their capability of clustering world countries.
This is done on the basis of real world socio economic data consisting in an integration of two datasets which, together, keep different domains of information, from geographical to demographic, political, social, economical and data gathered with a more "holistic" approach.
All clustering techniques were implemented and integrated into a Python application with a lightweight graphical user interface, designed to facilitate the execution of the algorithms and the collection of all the necessary outputs.
Preprocessing of the data and analysis of clustering techniques quality was done separately from the main interface.

To start the graphical interface of the project, simply run the app.py script inside the graphic_intf folder
