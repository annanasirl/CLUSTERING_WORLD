Balance of payments data on FDI do not include capital raised locally, an important source of investment financing in some developing countries. In addition, FDI data omit nonequity cross-border transactions such as intra-unit flows of goods and services.

The volume of global private financial flows reported by the World Bank generally differs from that reported by other sources because of differences in sources, classification of economies, and method used to adjust and disaggregate reported information. In addition, particularly for debt financing, differences may also reflect how some installments of the transactions and certain offshore issuances are treated.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) data are supplemented by the World Bank staff estimates using data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and official national sources.

The internationally accepted definition of FDI (from the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual [2009]), includes the following components: equity investment, including investment associated with equity that gives rise to control or influence; investment in indirectly influenced or controlled enterprises; investment in fellow enterprises; debt (except selected debt); and reverse investment. The Framework for Direct Investment Relationships provides criteria for determining whether cross-border ownership results in a direct investment relationship, based on control and influence. Distinguished from other kinds of international investment, FDI is made to establish a lasting interest in or effective management control over an enterprise in another country. A lasting interest in an investment enterprise typically involves establishing warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and other permanent or long-term organizations abroad. Direct investments may take the form of greenfield investment, where the investor starts a new venture in a foreign country by constructing new operational facilities; joint venture, where the investor enters into a partnership agreement with a company abroad to establish a new enterprise; or merger and acquisition, where the investor acquires an existing enterprise abroad. The IMF suggests that investments should account for at least 10 percent of voting stock to be counted as FDI. In practice many countries set a higher threshold. Many countries fail to report reinvested earnings, and the definition of long-term loans differs among countries.

Balance of payments data on FDI do not include capital raised locally, an important source of investment financing in some developing countries. In addition, FDI data omit nonequity cross-border transactions such as intra-unit flows of goods and services.

The volume of global private financial flows reported by the World Bank generally differs from that reported by other sources because of differences in sources, classification of economies, and method used to adjust and disaggregate reported information. In addition, particularly for debt financing, differences may also reflect how some installments of the transactions and certain offshore issuances are treated.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) data are supplemented by the World Bank staff estimates using data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and official national sources.

The internationally accepted definition of FDI (from the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual [2009]), includes the following components: equity investment, including investment associated with equity that gives rise to control or influence; investment in indirectly influenced or controlled enterprises; investment in fellow enterprises; debt (except selected debt); and reverse investment. The Framework for Direct Investment Relationships provides criteria for determining whether cross-border ownership results in a direct investment relationship, based on control and influence. Distinguished from other kinds of international investment, FDI is made to establish a lasting interest in or effective management control over an enterprise in another country. A lasting interest in an investment enterprise typically involves establishing warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and other permanent or long-term organizations abroad. Direct investments may take the form of greenfield investment, where the investor starts a new venture in a foreign country by constructing new operational facilities; joint venture, where the investor enters into a partnership agreement with a company abroad to establish a new enterprise; or merger and acquisition, where the investor acquires an existing enterprise abroad. The IMF suggests that investments should account for at least 10 percent of voting stock to be counted as FDI. In practice many countries set a higher threshold. Many countries fail to report reinvested earnings, and the definition of long-term loans differs among countries.

Data are in current U.S. dollars.",,Annual,,Note: Data starting from 2005 are based on the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6).,Sum,"Remittance transactions have grown in importance over the past decade. In a number of developing economies, receipts of remittances have become an important and stable source of funds that exceeds receipts from exports of goods and services or from financial inflows on foreign direct investment. But the quality of statistical remittance data is not high. Remittances are a challenge to measure because of their nature. They are heterogeneous with numerous small transactions conducted by individuals through a wide variety of channels: formal channels, such as electronic wire, or through informal channels, such as cash or goods carried across borders. The large number of remittance transactions and the multitude of channels pose challenges to the compilation of comprehensive statistics. The small size of individual transactions means that they often go undetected by typical data source systems, although the aggregate level of transactions may be substantial.

Because of difficulties in obtaining data on informal remittance transactions, the remittance transactions undertaken through informal channels are sometimes not well covered in current balance of payments data. As a result, even though direct measurement of remittances - through transactions reporting or surveys - may be considered preferable if feasible, some countries instead combine different sources and estimation methods to achieve better coverage, by using direct measurements where practical and supplemented estimates where they are not. Model-based approaches are used in some countries as they are flexible. Compilers can design models to fill gaps in data sources or to provide global totals.

However, only reliable input data can lead to sound estimates, regardless of the sophistication of an estimation method or econometric model. Indirect data are converted to remittance estimates using a set of assumptions. These assumptions should be plausible, but it is often not possible to test or verify these assumptions and also the results in practice.",,,"IMF balance of payments data, International Monetary Fund (IMF);
Staff estimates, World Bank (WB)","Methodology: The two main components of personal remittances, ""personal transfers"" and ""compensation of employees"", are items in the balance of payments (BPM6) framework. Both of these standard components are recorded in the current account. 
""Personal transfers,"" a new item in the Balance of Payments (BPM6) represents a broader definition of worker remittances. Personal transfers include all current transfers in cash or in kind between resident and nonresident individuals, independent of the source of income of the sender (irrespective of whether the sender receives income from labor, entrepreneurial or property income, social benefits, and any other types of transfers; or disposes assets) and the relationship between the households (irrespective of whether they are related or unrelated individuals).

Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by nonresident entities. Compensation of employees represents remuneration in return for the labor input to the production process contributed by an individual in an employer-employee relationship with the enterprise. Compensation of employees is recorded gross and includes amounts paid by the employee as taxes or for other purposes in the economy where the work is performed. Compensation of employees has three main components: wages and salaries in cash, wages and salaries in kind, and employers' social contributions.","Movement of people, most often through migration, is a significant part of global integration. Migrants contribute to the economies of both their host country and their country of origin. Yet reliable statistics on migration are difficult to collect and are often incomplete, making international comparisons a challenge.

In most developed countries, refugees are admitted for resettlement and are routinely included in population counts by censuses or population registers. Globally, the number of refugees at end 2010 was 10.55 million, including 597,300 people considered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to be in a refugee-like situation; developing countries hosted 8.5 million refugees, or 80 percent of the global refugee population.

Global migration patterns have become increasingly complex in modern times, involving not just refugees, but also millions of economic migrants. But refugees and migrants, even if they often travel in the same way, are fundamentally different, and for that reason are treated very differently under modern international law. Migrants, especially economic migrants, choose to move in order to improve the future prospects of themselves and their families. Refugees have to move if they are to save their lives or preserve their freedom. They have no protection from their own state - indeed it is often their own government that is threatening to persecute them. If other countries do not let them in, and do not help them once they are in, then they may be condemning them to death - or to an intolerable life in the shadows, without sustenance and without rights.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Data are available online at: https://data-explorer.oecd.org/.","Methodology: The term technical co-operation covers a large variety of aid activities. Some technical co-operation is extended in the form of projects.

Non-project technical co-operation comprises activities such as the supply of volunteers or experts, other technical assistance, provision of scholarships and imputed student costs. Many of these activities are funded through specific TC budget lines, which may or may not be administered by the main aid agency. The exact use of funds is seldom known at the commitment stage. Consequently, data on the sectoral and geographical breakdown of such programmes are often collected on a disbursement basis only. As disbursement data can be very detailed (one “activity” corresponding to one individual expert or student), aggregation by recipient and sector (purpose code) is recommended prior to reporting to the CRS++. Grants of technical co-operation to individual countries include the actual or imputed costs of tuition in the reporting country of nationals of developing countries concerned. 

Free-standing technical co-operation comprises activities financed by a donor country whose primary purpose is to augment the level of knowledge, skills, technical know-how or productive aptitudes of the population of developing countries, i.e. increasing their stock of human intellectual capital, or their capacity for more effective use of their existing factor endowment. This relates essentially to activities that either enhance or supply human resources. It includes financing of students and trainees who are nationals of developing countries; experts, teachers, and volunteers; equipment and materials for training; research; development-oriented social and cultural programmes, etc. Associated supplies are also classified as technical co-operation.

In a number of developing economies, receipts of remittances have become an important and stable source of funds that exceeds receipts from exports of goods and services or from financial inflows on foreign direct investment. But the quality of statistical remittance data is not high. Remittances are a challenge to measure because of their nature. They are heterogeneous with numerous small transactions conducted by individuals through a wide variety of channels: formal channels, such as electronic wire, or through informal channels, such as cash or goods carried across borders. The large number of remittance transactions and the multitude of channels pose challenges to the compilation of comprehensive statistics. The small size of individual transactions means that they often go undetected by typical data source systems, although the aggregate level of transactions may be substantial.

Because of difficulties in obtaining data on informal remittance transactions, the remittance transactions undertaken through informal channels are sometimes not well covered in current balance of payments data. As a result, even though direct measurement of remittances - through transactions reporting or surveys - may be considered preferable if feasible, some countries instead combine different sources and estimation methods to achieve better coverage, by using direct measurements where practical and supplemented estimates where they are not. Model-based approaches are used in some countries as they are flexible. Compilers can design models to fill gaps in data sources or to provide global totals.

However, only reliable input data can lead to sound estimates, regardless of the sophistication of an estimation method or econometric model.

Staff estimates, World Bank (WB)","Methodology: The two main components of personal remittances, ""personal transfers"" and ""compensation of employees"", are items in the balance of payments (BPM6) framework. Both of these standard components are recorded in the current account. 
""Personal transfers"", a new item in the Balance of Payments (BPM6) represents a broader definition of worker remittances. Personal transfers include all current transfers in cash or in kind between resident and nonresident individuals, independent of the source of income of the sender (irrespective of whether the sender receives income from labor, entrepreneurial or property income, social benefits, and any other types of transfers; or disposes assets) and the relationship between the households (irrespective of whether they are related or unrelated individuals).

Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by nonresident entities. Compensation of employees represents remuneration in return for the labor input to the production process contributed by an individual in an employer-employee relationship with the enterprise. Compensation of employees is recorded gross and includes amounts paid by the employee as taxes or for other purposes in the economy where the work is performed. Compensation of employees has three main components: wages and salaries in cash, wages and salaries in kind, and employers' social contributions.","Movement of people, most often through migration, is a significant part of global integration. Migrants contribute to the economies of both their host country and their country of origin. Yet reliable statistics on migration are difficult to collect and are often incomplete, making international comparisons a challenge.

In most developed countries, refugees are admitted for resettlement and are routinely included in population counts by censuses or population registers. Globally, the number of refugees at end 2010 was 10.55 million, including 597,300 people considered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to be in a refugee-like situation; developing countries hosted 8.5 million refugees, or 80 percent of the global refugee population.

Global migration patterns have become increasingly complex in modern times, involving not just refugees, but also millions of economic migrants. But refugees and migrants, even if they often travel in the same way, are fundamentally different, and for that reason are treated very differently under modern international law. Migrants, especially economic migrants, choose to move in order to improve the future prospects of themselves and their families. Refugees have to move if they are to save their lives or preserve their freedom. They have no protection from their own state - indeed it is often their own government that is threatening to persecute them. If other countries do not let them in, and do not help them once they are in, then they may be condemning them to death - or to an intolerable life in the shadows, without sustenance and without rights.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Total reserves includes gold.,,Annual,,,Weighted average,"The DRS encourages debtor countries to voluntarily provide information on their short-term external obligations. By its nature, short-term external debt is difficult to monitor: loan-by-loan registration is normally impractical, and monitoring systems typically rely on information requested periodically by the central bank from the banking sector. The World Bank regards the debtor country as the authoritative source of information on its short-term debt. Where such information is not available from the debtor country, data are derived from BIS data on international bank lending based on time remaining to original maturity. The data are reported based on residual maturity, but an estimate of short-term external liabilities by original maturity can be derived by deducting from claims due in one year those that have a maturity of between one and two years. However, BIS data include liabilities reported only by banks within the BIS reporting area. The results should thus be interpreted with caution. Because short-term debt poses an immediate burden and is particularly important for monitoring vulnerability, it is compared with total debt and foreign exchange reserves, which are instrumental in providing coverage for such obligations.

A country's external debt burden, both debt outstanding and debt service, affects its creditworthiness and vulnerability. While data related to public and publicly guaranteed debt are reported to the DRS on a loan-by-loan basis, aggregate data on long-term private nonguaranteed debt are reported annually and are reported by the country or estimated by World Bank staff for countries where this type of external debt is known to be significant.

The debtors can be the government, corporations or private households. The debt includes money owed to private commercial banks, other governments, or international financial institutions.

External indebtedness affects a country's creditworthiness and investor perceptions. Nonreporting countries might have outstanding debt with the World Bank, other international financial institutions, or private creditors. Total debt service is contrasted with countries' ability to obtain foreign exchange through exports of goods, services, primary income, and workers' remittances.

Present value of debt is the sum of short-term external debt plus the discounted sum of total debt service payments due on public, publicly guaranteed, and private nonguaranteed long-term external debt over the life of existing loans. The PV of external debt is a better measure for debt burden's of countries that have access to concessional financing. The IMF/World Bank's Low-Income Countries (LICs) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) uses the present value of external debt as a means to assess a country's risk of external and overall debt distress.

Debt ratios are used to assess the sustainability of a country's debt service obligations, but no absolute rules determine what values are too high. Empirical analysis of developing countries' experience and debt service performance shows that debt service difficulties become increasingly likely when the present value of debt reaches 200 percent of exports. Still, what constitutes a sustainable debt burden varies by country. Countries with fast-growing economies and exports are likely to be able to sustain higher debt levels. Various indicators determine a sustainable level of external debt, including:

a) debt to GDP ratio
b) foreign debt to exports ratio
c) government debt to current fiscal revenue ratio 
d) share of foreign debt
e) short-term debt
f) concessional debt in the total debt stock",,,,CC BY-4.0

Data are in current U.S. dollars.,,Annual,,,Sum,"The DRS encourages debtor countries to voluntarily provide information on their short-term external obligations. By its nature, short-term external debt is difficult to monitor: loan-by-loan registration is normally impractical, and monitoring systems typically rely on information requested periodically by the central bank from the banking sector. The World Bank regards the debtor country as the authoritative source of information on its short-term debt. Where such information is not available from the debtor country, data are derived from BIS data on international bank lending based on time remaining to original maturity. The data are reported based on residual maturity, but an estimate of short-term external liabilities by original maturity can be derived by deducting from claims due in one year those that have a maturity of between one and two years. However, BIS data include liabilities reported only by banks within the BIS reporting area. The results should thus be interpreted with caution. Because short-term debt poses an immediate burden and is particularly important for monitoring vulnerability, it is compared with total debt and foreign exchange reserves, which are instrumental in providing coverage for such obligations.

A country's external debt burden, both debt outstanding and debt service, affects its creditworthiness and vulnerability. While data related to public and publicly guaranteed debt are reported to the DRS on a loan-by-loan basis, aggregate data on long-term private nonguaranteed debt are reported annually and are reported by the country or estimated by World Bank staff for countries where this type of external debt is known to be significant. Estimates are based on national data from the World Bank's Quarterly External Debt Statistics.",,,"International Debt Statistics, World Bank (WB)","Methodology: Bonds are debt instruments issued by public and publicly guaranteed or private debtors with durations of one year or longer.

Ratio of aid to gross capital formation provides measures of recipient country's dependency on aid. But care must be taken in drawing policy conclusions. For foreign policy reasons some countries have traditionally received large amounts of aid. Thus aid dependency ratio may reveal as much about a donor's interests as about a recipient's needs. The quality of data on government fixed capital formation depends on the quality of government accounting systems which tend to be weak in developing countries. Measures of fixed capital formation by households and corporations - particularly capital outlays by small, unincorporated enterprises - are usually unreliable.

For foreign policy reasons some countries have traditionally received large amounts of aid. Thus aid dependency ratio may reveal as much about a donor's interests as about a recipient's needs. Data on imports are compiled from customs reports and balance of payments data. Although data from the payments side provide reasonably reliable records of cross-border transactions, they may not adhere strictly to the appropriate definitions of valuation and timing used in the balance of payments or correspond to the change of ownership criterion. This issue has assumed greater significance with the increasing globalization of international business. Neither customs nor balance of payments data usually capture the illegal transactions that occur in many countries. Goods carried by travelers across borders in league but unreported shuttle trade may further distort trade statistics.

Because the indicator relies on information from donors, it is not necessarily consistent with information recorded by recipients in the balance of payments, which often excludes all or some technical assistance - particularly payments to expatriates made directly by the donor. Similarly, grant commodity aid may not always be recorded in trade data or in the balance of payments. Moreover, DAC statistics exclude aid for military and antiterrorism purposes.

Data on imports are compiled from customs reports and balance of payments data. They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services. They exclude compensation of employees and investment income (factor services in the 1969 SNA) and transfer payments.

The flows of official and private financial resources from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to developing economies are compiled by DAC, based principally on reporting by DAC members using standard questionnaires issued by the DAC Secretariat.

The ODA excludes nonconcessional flows from official creditors, which are classified as ""other official flows,"" and aid for military and anti-terrorism purposes. Transfer payments to private individuals, such as pensions, reparations, and insurance payouts, are in general not counted. In addition to financial flows, ODA includes technical cooperation, most expenditures for peacekeeping under UN mandates and assistance to refugees, contributions to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and its specialized agencies, and concessional funding to multilateral development banks.

Flows are transfers of resources, either in cash or in the form of commodities or services measured on a cash basis. Short-term capital transactions (with one year or less maturity) are not counted. Repayments of the principal (but not interest) of ODA loans are recorded as negative flows. Proceeds from official equity investments in a developing country are reported as ODA, while proceeds from their later sale are recorded as negative flows.

The official development assistance estimates are published annually at the end of the calendar year in International Development Statistics (IDS) database. Net ODA received as a percent of imports of goods and services is calculated using values in U.S. dollars converted at official exchange rates.","The ratio of aid to imports of goods and services provides a measure of recipient country's dependency on aid. Ratios of aid are generally much higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other regions, and they increased in the 1980s. High ratios are due only in part to aid flows. Many African countries saw severe erosion in their terms of trade in the 1980s, along with weak policies, falling incomes, imports, and investment. Thus the increase in aid dependency ratios reflects events affecting both the numerator (aid) and the denominator (imports of goods and services).

Measures of growth in consumption and capital formation are subject to two kinds of inaccuracy. The first stems from the difficulty of measuring expenditures at current price levels. The second arises in deflating current price data to measure volume growth, where results depend on the relevance and reliability of the price indexes and weights used. Measuring price changes is more difficult for investment goods than for consumption goods because of the one-time nature of many investments and because the rate of technological progress in capital goods makes capturing change in quality difficult. (An example is computers - prices have fallen as quality has improved.)





To obtain government consumption in constant prices, countries may deflate current values by applying a wage (price) index or extrapolate from the change in government employment.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products and non-traded products when market exchange rates are used to convert GDP to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDP does not have this bias because PPPs account for the different price levels of traded products and non-traded products. Thus, PPPs are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants and are also less impacted by the potential volatility of market exchange rates. PPPs are calculated by the International Comparison Program (ICP) based on the prices of goods and services within an economy and national accounts expenditures. 

The conceptual elements of the SNA (System of National Accounts) measure what takes place in the economy, between which agents, and for what purpose. At the heart of the SNA is the production of goods and services. These may be used for consumption in the period to which the accounts relate or may be accumulated for use in a later period. In simple terms, the amount of value added generated by production represents GDP. The income corresponding to GDP is distributed to the various agents or groups of agents as income and it is the process of distributing and redistributing income that allows one agent to consume the goods and services produced by another agent or to acquire goods and services for later consumption. The way in which the SNA captures this pattern of economic flows is to identify the activities concerned by recognizing the institutional units in the economy and by specifying the structure of accounts capturing the transactions relevant to one stage or another of the process by which goods and services are produced and ultimately consumed.","PPPs are used to convert national accounts data from different countries, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between countries. PPPs are also used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.
The PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.  PPP-based indicators are used for national, regional, and global policy making and analysis across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty and inequality, to health and education, to energy and climate, through to economic growth, labor, productivity, trade, competitiveness, and infrastructure. A number of Sustainable Development Goals use PPP-based indicators to measure development progress.

This indicator is related to the national accounts, which are critical for understanding and managing a country's economy. They provide a framework for the analysis of economic performance. National accounts are the basis for estimating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI), which are the most widely used indicator of economic performance. They are essential for government policymakers, providing the data needed to design and assess fiscal and monetary policies; and are also used by businesses and investors to assess the economic climate and make investment decisions. NAS enable comparison between economies, which is crucial for international trade, investment decisions, and economic competitiveness. More specifically, this indicator is related to national accounts aggregates. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Income (GNI), and other aggregates provide a snapshot of the size and health of an economy by measuring the total economic activity within a country. They can thus be used by policymakers to design and implement economic policies, as they reflect the overall economic performance and can indicate the need for intervention in certain areas. Aggregates also allow for comparisons between different economies, which can be useful for trade negotiations, investment decisions, and economic benchmarking.

Households and NPISHs final consumption expenditure includes expenditure on goods and services by the Household and NPISH sector for the direct satisfaction of human needs or wants, whether individual or collective. This indicator is expressed in constant prices, meaning the series has been adjusted to account for price changes over time. The reference year for this adjustment is 2021.

The ICP is conducted as a global partnership of countries, multilateral agencies, and academia. The recent 2021 ICP comparison covered 176 countries, including 49 Eurostat-OECD countries. For countries that have not participated in ICP comparisons, the PPP are imputed based on a regression model. ICP estimated PPPs cover years from 2011 to 2021. WDI extrapolates 2011 PPPs for years earlier years, and 2021 PPPs for later years. For the member countries of Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme, PPP conversion factors are periodically updated based on the organizations’ databases. 

National accounts are compiled in accordance with international standards: System of National Accounts, 2008 or 1993 versions. Specific information on how countries compile their national accounts can be found on the IMF website: https://dsbb.imf.org/  Linked series have been smoothed to remove breaks resulting from changes in base years, data sources or compilation methods. The linking is performed using historical nominal growth rates from archived WDI databases.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products and non-traded products when market exchange rates are used to convert GDP to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDP does not have this bias because PPPs account for the different price levels of traded products and non-traded products. Thus, PPPs are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants and are also less impacted by the potential volatility of market exchange rates. PPPs are calculated by the International Comparison Program (ICP) based on the prices of goods and services within an economy and national accounts expenditures. 

The conceptual elements of the SNA (System of National Accounts) measure what takes place in the economy, between which agents, and for what purpose. At the heart of the SNA is the production of goods and services. These may be used for consumption in the period to which the accounts relate or may be accumulated for use in a later period. In simple terms, the amount of value added generated by production represents GDP. The income corresponding to GDP is distributed to the various agents or groups of agents as income and it is the process of distributing and redistributing income that allows one agent to consume the goods and services produced by another agent or to acquire goods and services for later consumption. The way in which the SNA captures this pattern of economic flows is to identify the activities concerned by recognizing the institutional units in the economy and by specifying the structure of accounts capturing the transactions relevant to one stage or another of the process by which goods and services are produced and ultimately consumed.","PPPs are used to convert national accounts data from different countries, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between countries. PPPs are also used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.
The PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.  PPP-based indicators are used for national, regional, and global policy making and analysis across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty and inequality, to health and education, to energy and climate, through to economic growth, labor, productivity, trade, competitiveness, and infrastructure. A number of Sustainable Development Goals use PPP-based indicators to measure development progress.

This indicator is related to the national accounts, which are critical for understanding and managing a country's economy. They provide a framework for the analysis of economic performance. National accounts are the basis for estimating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI), which are the most widely used indicator of economic performance. They are essential for government policymakers, providing the data needed to design and assess fiscal and monetary policies; and are also used by businesses and investors to assess the economic climate and make investment decisions. NAS enable comparison between economies, which is crucial for international trade, investment decisions, and economic competitiveness. More specifically, this indicator is related to national accounts aggregates. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Income (GNI), and other aggregates provide a snapshot of the size and health of an economy by measuring the total economic activity within a country. They can thus be used by policymakers to design and implement economic policies, as they reflect the overall economic performance and can indicate the need for intervention in certain areas. Aggregates also allow for comparisons between different economies, which can be useful for trade negotiations, investment decisions, and economic benchmarking. By examining aggregates over time, economists and analysts can identify trends, cycles, and potential areas of concern within an economy, and investors can use national accounts aggregates to assess the potential risks and returns of investing in a particular country.

Moreover, many countries do not estimate all the components of national expenditures but instead derive some of the main aggregates indirectly using GDP (based on the production approach) as the control total. Household final consumption expenditure is often estimated as a residual, by subtracting all other known expenditures from GDP. The resulting aggregate may incorporate fairly large discrepancies. When household consumption is calculated separately, many of the estimates are based on household surveys, which tend to be one-year studies with limited coverage. Thus the estimates quickly become outdated and must be supplemented by estimates using price- and quantity-based statistical procedures. Complicating the issue, in many developing countries the distinction between cash outlays for personal business and those for household use may be blurred.





Informal economic activities pose a particular measurement problem, especially in developing countries, where much economic activity is unrecorded. A complete picture of the economy requires estimating household outputs produced for home use, sales in informal markets, barter exchanges, and illicit or deliberately unreported activities.

Moreover, many countries do not estimate all the components of national expenditures but instead derive some of the main aggregates indirectly using GDP (based on the production approach) as the control total.





Data on exports and imports are compiled from customs reports and balance of payments data. Although the data from the payments side provide reasonably reliable records of cross-border transactions, they may not adhere strictly to the appropriate definitions of valuation and timing used in the balance of payments or corresponds to the change-of ownership criterion. This issue has assumed greater significance with the increasing globalization of international business. Neither customs nor balance of payments data usually capture the illegal transactions that occur in many countries.

Measures of growth in consumption and capital formation are subject to two kinds of inaccuracy. The first stems from the difficulty of measuring expenditures at current price levels. The second arises in deflating current price data to measure volume growth, where results depend on the relevance and reliability of the price indexes and weights used. Measuring price changes is more difficult for investment goods than for consumption goods because of the one-time nature of many investments and because the rate of technological progress in capital goods makes capturing change in quality difficult. (An example is computers - prices have fallen as quality has improved.) Several countries estimate capital formation from the supply side, identifying capital goods entering an economy directly from detailed production and international trade statistics. This means that the price indexes used in deflating production and international trade, reflecting delivered or offered prices, will determine the deflator for capital formation expenditures on the demand side.",,,"Country official statistics, National Statistical Organizations and/or Central Banks;

For both energy and mineral depletion, unit resource rent is calculated as (unit world price - average cost) / unit world price. Marginal cost should be used instead of average cost in order to calculate the true opportunity cost of extraction; however, marginal cost is difficult to compute and data are not readily available. Unit prices refer to international rather than local prices to reflect the social cost of natural resources depletion.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products and non-traded products when market exchange rates are used to convert GDP to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDP does not have this bias because PPPs account for the different price levels of traded products and non-traded products. Thus, PPPs are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants and are also less impacted by the potential volatility of market exchange rates. PPPs are calculated by the International Comparison Program (ICP) based on the prices of goods and services within an economy and national accounts expenditures. 

The  conceptual elements of the SNA (System of National Accounts) measure what takes place in the economy, between which agents, and for what purpose.

The way in which the SNA captures this pattern of economic flows is to identify the activities concerned by recognizing the institutional units in the economy and by specifying the structure of accounts capturing the transactions relevant to one stage or another of the process by which goods and services are produced and ultimately consumed.","PPPs are used to convert national accounts data from different countries, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between countries. PPPs are also used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.
The PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.  PPP-based indicators are used for national, regional, and global policy making and analysis across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty and inequality, to health and education, to energy and climate, through to economic growth, labor, productivity, trade, competitiveness, and infrastructure. A number of Sustainable Development Goals use PPP-based indicators to measure development progress.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products and non-traded products when market exchange rates are used to convert GDP to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDP does not have this bias because PPPs account for the different price levels of traded products and non-traded products. Thus, PPPs are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants and are also less impacted by the potential volatility of market exchange rates. PPPs are calculated by the International Comparison Program (ICP) based on the prices of goods and services within an economy and national accounts expenditures. 

The  conceptual elements of the SNA (System of National Accounts) measure what takes place in the economy, between which agents, and for what purpose. At the heart of the SNA is the production of goods and services. These may be used for consumption in the period to which the accounts relate or may be accumulated for use in a later period. In simple terms, the amount of value added generated by production represents GDP. The income corresponding to GDP is distributed to the various agents or groups of agents as income and it is the process of distributing and redistributing income that allows one agent to consume the goods and services produced by another agent or to acquire goods and services for later consumption. The way in which the SNA captures this pattern of economic flows is to identify the activities concerned by recognizing the institutional units in the economy and by specifying the structure of accounts capturing the transactions relevant to one stage or another of the process by which goods and services are produced and ultimately consumed.","PPPs are used to convert national accounts data from different countries, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between countries. PPPs are also used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.
The PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.  PPP-based indicators are used for national, regional, and global policy making and analysis across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty and inequality, to health and education, to energy and climate, through to economic growth, labor, productivity, trade, competitiveness, and infrastructure. A number of Sustainable Development Goals use PPP-based indicators to measure development progress.

This indicator is related to the national accounts, which are critical for understanding and managing a country's economy. They provide a framework for the analysis of economic performance. National accounts are the basis for estimating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI), which are the most widely used indicator of economic performance.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products and non-traded products when market exchange rates are used to convert GDP to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDP does not have this bias because PPPs account for the different price levels of traded products and non-traded products. Thus, PPPs are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants and are also less impacted by the potential volatility of market exchange rates. PPPs are calculated by the International Comparison Program (ICP) based on the prices of goods and services within an economy and national accounts expenditures. 

The  conceptual elements of the SNA (System of National Accounts) measure what takes place in the economy, between which agents, and for what purpose. At the heart of the SNA is the production of goods and services. These may be used for consumption in the period to which the accounts relate or may be accumulated for use in a later period. In simple terms, the amount of value added generated by production represents GDP. The income corresponding to GDP is distributed to the various agents or groups of agents as income and it is the process of distributing and redistributing income that allows one agent to consume the goods and services produced by another agent or to acquire goods and services for later consumption. The way in which the SNA captures this pattern of economic flows is to identify the activities concerned by recognizing the institutional units in the economy and by specifying the structure of accounts capturing the transactions relevant to one stage or another of the process by which goods and services are produced and ultimately consumed.","PPPs are used to convert national accounts data from different countries, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between countries. PPPs are also used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.
The PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.  PPP-based indicators are used for national, regional, and global policy making and analysis across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty and inequality, to health and education, to energy and climate, through to economic growth, labor, productivity, trade, competitiveness, and infrastructure. A number of Sustainable Development Goals use PPP-based indicators to measure development progress.

This indicator is related to the national accounts, which are critical for understanding and managing a country's economy. They provide a framework for the analysis of economic performance. National accounts are the basis for estimating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI), which are the most widely used indicator of economic performance. They are essential for government policymakers, providing the data needed to design and assess fiscal and monetary policies; and are also used by businesses and investors to assess the economic climate and make investment decisions. NAS enable comparison between economies, which is crucial for international trade, investment decisions, and economic competitiveness. More specifically, this indicator is related to national accounts aggregates. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Income (GNI), and other aggregates provide a snapshot of the size and health of an economy by measuring the total economic activity within a country. They can thus be used by policymakers to design and implement economic policies, as they reflect the overall economic performance and can indicate the need for intervention in certain areas. Aggregates also allow for comparisons between different economies, which can be useful for trade negotiations, investment decisions, and economic benchmarking. By examining aggregates over time, economists and analysts can identify trends, cycles, and potential areas of concern within an economy, and investors can use national accounts aggregates to assess the potential risks and returns of investing in a particular country.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products and non-traded products when market exchange rates are used to convert GDP to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDP does not have this bias because PPPs account for the different price levels of traded products and non-traded products. Thus, PPPs are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants and are also less impacted by the potential volatility of market exchange rates. PPPs are calculated by the International Comparison Program (ICP) based on the prices of goods and services within an economy and national accounts expenditures.

PPPs are also used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.
The PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.  PPP-based indicators are used for national, regional, and global policy making and analysis across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty and inequality, to health and education, to energy and climate, through to economic growth, labor, productivity, trade, competitiveness, and infrastructure.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products and non-traded products when market exchange rates are used to convert GDP to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDP does not have this bias because PPPs account for the different price levels of traded products and non-traded products. Thus, PPPs are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants and are also less impacted by the potential volatility of market exchange rates. PPPs are calculated by the International Comparison Program (ICP) based on the prices of goods and services within an economy and national accounts expenditures.

PPPs are also used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.
The PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.  PPP-based indicators are used for national, regional, and global policy making and analysis across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty and inequality, to health and education, to energy and climate, through to economic growth, labor, productivity, trade, competitiveness, and infrastructure.

For countries that have not participated in ICP comparisons, the PPP are imputed based on a regression model.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products and non-traded products when market exchange rates are used to convert GDP to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDP does not have this bias because PPPs account for the different price levels of traded products and non-traded products. Thus, PPPs are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants and are also less impacted by the potential volatility of market exchange rates. 

PPPs are calculated by the International Comparison Program (ICP) based on the prices of goods and services within an economy and national accounts expenditures. See https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp/methodology.","PPPs are used to convert national accounts data from different countries, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between countries. PPPs are also used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.
PPPs, PLIs, and the PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.  PPP-based indicators are used for national, regional, and global policy making and analysis across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty and inequality, to health and education, to energy and climate, through to economic growth, labor, productivity, trade, competitiveness, and infrastructure. A number of Sustainable Development Goals use PPP-based indicators to measure development progress.

Statistical concept(s): 1. The ratio of the GDPs of two economies when both are valued at national price levels and
expressed in local currency units has three component ratios:
GDP ratio = price level ratio × volume ratio × currency ratio. (B3.1.1)
2. When converting the GDP ratio in equation (B3.1.1) to a common currency using the
market exchange rate, the resulting GDPXR ratio has two component ratios:
GDPXR ratio = price level ratio × volume ratio. (B3.1.2)
 The GDP ratio in equation (B3.1.2) is expressed in a common currency, but it reflects both
the price level differences and the volume differences between the two economies.
3. A PPP is defined as a spatial price deflator and currency converter. It is composed of two
component ratios:
PPP = price level ratio × currency ratio. (B3.1.3)
4. When a PPP is used, the GDP ratio in equation (B3.1.1) is divided by equation (B3.1.3),
and the resulting GDPPPP ratio has only one component ratio:
GDPPPP ratio = volume ratio. (B3.1.4)
 The GDP ratio in equation (B3.1.4) is expressed in a common currency, is valued at a common price level, and reflects only differences in volume between the two economies.","The price level ratio provides a comparison of price levels across countries. If a country’s price level ratio is lower than that of another country, then its items or expenditure aggregates are less expensive than those in the other country. Conversely, if a country’s PLI is higher than that of another country, then its items or expenditure aggregates are more expensive than those in the other country.

Purchasing power parities (PPPs), price level ratios, and PPP-based expenditures to which they give rise are primarily used to make spatial comparisons of volume and per capita consumption or levels of GDP and its expenditure components across countries.

Statistical concept(s): PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency.  In the process of conversion, they control for differences in the price levels of economies, and thus equalize purchasing power. PPP-based comparisons of economic output differ from market exchange rate-based comparisons as the latter do not distinguish between the relative price levels of different items in economies. Overall price levels are normally higher in higher-income economies than they are in lower-income economies (Balassa-Samuelson effect), mostly because of the large differences in price levels for non-traded products. If no account is taken of the larger price level differences for non-traded products when converting GDP to a common currency, the size of higher-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of lower-income economies with low price levels will be understated.
