Statistical concept(s): This indicator assesses the level of women's participation in household decision-making. It emphasizes the importance of decisions regarding their own health care, which are deemed essential to women's self-interest. The indicator also evaluates women's involvement in making substantial economic decisions, such as those related to significant purchases, to gauge their economic decision-making power within the household. Additionally, it measures women's autonomy in deciding on visits to family or friends, which can indicate their freedom of movement and the ability to engage with their birth family.","Women‘s participation in decisions being made in their own households, that is households in which they usually live with their spouse and/or children with or without others, is widely accepted as a universal indicator of women‘s empowerment. The ability of women to make decisions that affect their personal circumstances is an essential element of their empowerment and serves as an important contributor to their overall development.",,,,CC BY-4.0

In the current Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS),  the question on decision-making on use of contraception is only asked to women who are currently using contraception. Because the questions on decision- making on sexual relations and health care are restricted to women (15-49) currently married or in union, the denominator for Indicator 5.6.1 is women 15-49, who are currently married or in union and currently using contraception.  However, agreement has been reached with Macro/ICF for upcoming DHS surveys to ask the question on decision on use of contraception to all married/ in union women aged 15-49 years, whether they are currently using any contraception or not.

Denominator of the indicator is the total number of women ages 15-49 who are married or in union and who have been interviewed.  













The data for this indicator are primarily sourced from nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).
Statistical concept(s): A woman is deemed to possess autonomy in reproductive health decision-making and to be empowered to assert her reproductive rights when she has the ability to: (1) make decisions regarding her own health care, independently or in conjunction with her husband or partner, (2) determine the use or non-use of contraception, on her own or together with her husband or partner, and (3) refuse sexual relations with her husband or partner if she chooses.","Women‘s participation in decisions being made in their own households, that is households in which they usually live with their spouse and/or children with or without others, is widely accepted as a universal indicator of women‘s empowerment.

There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events which are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are. Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women's contribution to political decision making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.











The data is compiled by the Inter-Parliamentary Union on the basis of information provided by National Parliaments. The percentages do not take into account the case of parliaments for which no data was available at that date.

Statistical concept(s): This indicator assesses the extent to which women are provided with equal opportunities to participate in parliamentary decision-making processes. It applies to the sole chamber of unicameral national parliaments and the lower chamber in the case of bicameral systems. The upper chamber in bicameral parliaments is not included in this measure. Parliamentary seats are typically occupied by individuals who are victorious in general elections, though they can also be acquired through nomination, appointment, indirect election, member rotation, or by-elections. The term 'seats' refers to the total count of parliamentary mandates or the total number of parliament members.","Despite much progress in recent decades, gender inequalities remain pervasive in many dimensions of life - worldwide. But while disparities exist throughout the world, they are most prevalent in developing countries. Gender inequalities in the allocation of such resources as education, health care, nutrition, and political voice matter because of the strong association with well-being, productivity, and economic growth. These patterns of inequality begin at an early age, with boys routinely receiving a larger share of education and health spending than do girls, for example.













Women are vastly underrepresented in decision-making positions in government, although there is some evidence of recent improvement. Gender parity in parliamentary representation is still far from being realized. Without representation at this level, it is difficult for women to influence policy.













A strong and vibrant democracy is possible only when parliament is fully inclusive of the population it represents. Parliaments cannot consider themselves inclusive, however, until they can boast the full participation of women. This is not just about women's right to equality and their contribution to the conduct of public affairs, but also about using women's resources and potential to determine political and development priorities that benefit societies and the global community.",,,,CC BY-4.0
