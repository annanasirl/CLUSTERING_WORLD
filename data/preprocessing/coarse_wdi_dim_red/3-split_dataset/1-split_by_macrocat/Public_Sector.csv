CC.EST,Public Sector,Control of Corruption: Estimate,,"The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are a research dataset summarizing the views on the quality of governance provided by a large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries. Governance consists of the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. This includes the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them. The WGI measures six dimensions of governance: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. 

Control of Corruption captures perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as ""capture"" of the state by elites and private interests.

Estimate gives the country's score on the aggregate indicator, in units of a standard normal distribution, i.e. ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5.","Units of a standard normal distribution (between -2.5 and 2.5, approximately)",Annual,,"The UCM assigns greater weight to data sources that tend to be more strongly correlated with each other.  While this weighting improves the statistical precision of the aggregate indicators, it typically does not affect very much the ranking of countries on the aggregate indicators.  The composite measures of governance generated by the UCM are in units of a standard normal distribution, with mean zero, standard deviation of one, and running from approximately -2.5 to 2.5, with higher values corresponding to better governance.  The data is also reported in percentile rank terms, ranging from 0 (lowest rank) to 100 (highest rank).

Statistical concept(s): The six aggregate indicators are reported in two ways: (1) in their standard normal units, ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5, and (2) in percentile rank terms from 0 to 100, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.

A key feature of the WGI is that all country scores are accompanied by standard errors. These standard errors reflect the number of sources available for a country and the extent to which these sources agree with each other (with more sources and more agreement leading to smaller standard errors). These standard errors reflect the reality that governance is difficult to measure using any kind of data. In most measures of governance or the investment climate they are however left implicit or ignored altogether.",,"The six composite WGI measures are useful as a tool for broad cross-country comparisons and for evaluating broad trends over time. However, they are often too blunt a tool to be useful in formulating specific governance reforms in particular country contexts. Such reforms, and evaluation of their progress, need to be informed by much more detailed and country-specific diagnostic data that can identify the relevant constraints on governance in particular country circumstances.

The WGI are complementary to a large number of other efforts to construct more detailed measures of governance, often just for a single country. Users are also encouraged to consult the disaggregated individual indicators underlying the composite WGI scores to gain more insights into the particular areas of strengths and weaknesses identified by the data.

The WGI are not used by the World Bank Group to allocate resources.",,,"Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Bank (WB), uri: www.govindicators.org, note: The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are a product of the staff of the World Bank with external contributions.","Methodology: The WGI are composite governance indicators based on over 30 underlying data sources. These data sources are rescaled and combined to create the six aggregate indicators using a statistical methodology known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM). A key feature of the methodology is that it generates margins of error for each governance estimate. These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. 

Each of the six aggregate WGI measures are constructed by averaging together data from the underlying sources that correspond to the concept of governance being measured.  This is done in the three steps:

STEP 1:  Assigning data from individual sources to the six aggregate indicators.  Individual questions from the underlying data sources are assigned to each of the six aggregate indicators.  For example, a firm survey question on the regulatory environment would be assigned to Regulatory Quality, or a measure of press freedom would be assigned to Voice and Accountability. The individual variables used in the WGI and how they are assigned to the six aggregate indicators, can be found on the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators].  Note that not all of the data sources cover all countries, and so the aggregate governance scores are based on different sets of underlying data for different countries.

STEP 2:  Rescaling of the individual source data to run from 0 to 1.  The questions from the individual data sources are first rescaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.  If, for example, a survey question asks for responses on a scale from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4, we rescale a score of 2 as (2-min)/(max-min)=(2-1)/3=0.33.  When an individual data source provides more than one question relating to a particular dimension of governance, the rescaled scores are averaged together.
The 0-1 rescaled data from the individual sources are available interactively through the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access] and in the data files for each individual source [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/documentation#2].  Although nominally in the same 0-1 units, this rescaled data is not necessarily comparable across sources.  For example, one data source might use a 0-10 scale but in practice most scores are clustered between 6 and 10, while another data source might also use a 0-10 scale but have responses spread out over the entire range.  While the max-min rescaling above does not correct for this source of non-comparability, the procedure used to construct the aggregate indicators does (see below).

STEP 3:  Using an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) to construct a weighted average of the individual indicators for each source.   A statistical tool known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) is used to make the 0-1 rescaled data comparable across sources, and then to construct a weighted average of the data from each source for each country.  The UCM assumes that the observed data from each source are a linear function of the unobserved level of governance, plus an error term.  This linear function is different for different data sources, and so corrects for the remaining non-comparability of units of the rescaled data noted above.  The resulting estimates of governance are a weighted average of the data from each source, with weights reflecting the pattern of correlation among data sources.  The weights applied to the component indicators.","Good governance is essential for development. It helps countries improve economic growth, build human capital, and strengthen social cohesion.

Number of sources indicates the number of underlying data sources on which the aggregate estimate is based.

The WGI are based on a large number of different data sources, capturing the views and experiences of survey respondents and experts in the public and private sectors, as well as various NGOs. These data sources include: (a) surveys of households and firms (e.g. Afrobarometer surveys, Gallup World Poll, and Global Competitiveness Report survey), (b) NGOs (e.g. Global Integrity, Freedom House, Reporters Without Borders), (c) commercial business information providers (e.g. Economist Intelligence Unit, S&P Global, Political Risk Services), and (d) public sector organizations (e.g. CPIA assessments of World Bank and regional development banks).

One advantage is that they lend themselves well to cross-country comparisons, as their methodologies are explicitly designed for this purpose. Expert assessments can also provide more granular technical assessments, for example on the quality of specific types of public institutions, that would be more difficult for a typical household or firm survey respondent to provide and informed view on. Expert assessments also are less likely to be affected by respondent reticence, a concern in household and firm surveys where respondents may be unwilling to give candid responses to sensitive questions about corruption or other dimensions of governance, particularly in countries where governance is weak. 

On the other hand, a shortcoming of expert assessments is that they reflect the views of a narrower set of respondents than household or firm surveys. It also is possible that the ratings provided by one expert assessment to some extent reflect the views of other expert assessments, so that each assessment does not bring completely independent information on the underlying governance concept of interest. To guard against this, the WGI do not use expert assessments that are explicitly based on other existing data sources.

•	The data sources must provide subjective perceptions of relevant dimensions of governance, as the WGI are based exclusively on this type of data.
•	The sources must provide original primary data produced using a well-defined methodology.
•	The data sources must cover multiple countries, so that cross-country comparisons are possible.
•	The data sources must be updated regularly, ideally every year, although some WGI data sources are updated once every two or three years.

The WGI draw on four different types of source data:

•	Surveys of households and firms, including the Afrobarometer surveys, Gallup World Poll, and Global Competitiveness Report survey,
•	Commercial business information providers, including the Economist Intelligence Unit, S&P Global, and Political Risk Services,
•	Non-governmental organizations, including Global Integrity, Freedom House, Reporters Without Borders, and
•	Public sector organizations, including the Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA) assessments of World Bank and regional development banks.

Statistical concept(s): Number of sources indicates the number of underlying data sources on which the aggregate estimate is based.

Variables from the data sources are assigned to each of these six governance dimensions.  For example, an assessment of the quality of the bureaucracy would be assigned to Government Effectiveness, a question about confidence in the police or the courts would be assigned to Rule of Law, and a question about the perceived likelihood of having to pay a bribe would be assigned to Control of Corruption.  In some cases, a single data source will have multiple questions that can be assigned to the same dimension.  In this case, the WGI use the average across all relevant questions from that data source. In addition each question from each data source is assigned to only one of the six governance dimensions, selecting the dimension that best matches the content of the question.","Good governance is essential for development.

GE.EST,Public Sector,Government Effectiveness: Estimate,,"The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are a research dataset summarizing the views on the quality of governance provided by a large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries. Governance consists of the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. This includes the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them. The WGI measures six dimensions of governance: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. 

Government Effectiveness captures perceptions and views of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies.

Estimate gives the country's score on the aggregate indicator, in units of a standard normal distribution, i.e. ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5.","Units of a standard normal distribution (between -2.5 and 2.5, approximately)",Annual,,"The UCM assigns greater weight to data sources that tend to be more strongly correlated with each other.  While this weighting improves the statistical precision of the aggregate indicators, it typically does not affect very much the ranking of countries on the aggregate indicators.  The composite measures of governance generated by the UCM are in units of a standard normal distribution, with mean zero, standard deviation of one, and running from approximately -2.5 to 2.5, with higher values corresponding to better governance.  The data is also reported in percentile rank terms, ranging from 0 (lowest rank) to 100 (highest rank).

Statistical concept(s): The six aggregate indicators are reported in two ways: (1) in their standard normal units, ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5, and (2) in percentile rank terms from 0 to 100, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.

A key feature of the WGI is that all country scores are accompanied by standard errors. These standard errors reflect the number of sources available for a country and the extent to which these sources agree with each other (with more sources and more agreement leading to smaller standard errors). These standard errors reflect the reality that governance is difficult to measure using any kind of data. In most measures of governance or the investment climate they are however left implicit or ignored altogether.",,"The six composite WGI measures are useful as a tool for broad cross-country comparisons and for evaluating broad trends over time. However, they are often too blunt a tool to be useful in formulating specific governance reforms in particular country contexts. Such reforms, and evaluation of their progress, need to be informed by much more detailed and country-specific diagnostic data that can identify the relevant constraints on governance in particular country circumstances.

The WGI are complementary to a large number of other efforts to construct more detailed measures of governance, often just for a single country. Users are also encouraged to consult the disaggregated individual indicators underlying the composite WGI scores to gain more insights into the particular areas of strengths and weaknesses identified by the data.

The WGI do not reflect the official views of the Natural Resource Governance Institute, the Brookings Institution, the World Bank, its Executive Directors, or the countries they represent. The WGI are not used by the World Bank Group to allocate resources.",,,"Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Bank (WB), uri: www.govindicators.org","Methodology: The WGI are composite governance indicators based on over 30 underlying data sources. These data sources are rescaled and combined to create the six aggregate indicators using a statistical methodology known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM). A key feature of the methodology is that it generates margins of error for each governance estimate. These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. 

Each of the six aggregate WGI measures are constructed by averaging together data from the underlying sources that correspond to the concept of governance being measured.  This is done in the three steps:

STEP 1:  Assigning data from individual sources to the six aggregate indicators.  Individual questions from the underlying data sources are assigned to each of the six aggregate indicators.  For example, a firm survey question on the regulatory environment would be assigned to Regulatory Quality, or a measure of press freedom would be assigned to Voice and Accountability. The individual variables used in the WGI and how they are assigned to the six aggregate indicators, can be found on the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators].  Note that not all of the data sources cover all countries, and so the aggregate governance scores are based on different sets of underlying data for different countries.

STEP 2:  Rescaling of the individual source data to run from 0 to 1.  The questions from the individual data sources are first rescaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.  If, for example, a survey question asks for responses on a scale from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4, we rescale a score of 2 as (2-min)/(max-min)=(2-1)/3=0.33.  When an individual data source provides more than one question relating to a particular dimension of governance, the rescaled scores are averaged together.
The 0-1 rescaled data from the individual sources are available interactively through the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access] and in the data files for each individual source [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/documentation#2].  Although nominally in the same 0-1 units, this rescaled data is not necessarily comparable across sources.  For example, one data source might use a 0-10 scale but in practice most scores are clustered between 6 and 10, while another data source might also use a 0-10 scale but have responses spread out over the entire range.  While the max-min rescaling above does not correct for this source of non-comparability, the procedure used to construct the aggregate indicators does (see below).

STEP 3:  Using an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) to construct a weighted average of the individual indicators for each source.   A statistical tool known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) is used to make the 0-1 rescaled data comparable across sources, and then to construct a weighted average of the data from each source for each country.  The UCM assumes that the observed data from each source are a linear function of the unobserved level of governance, plus an error term.  This linear function is different for different data sources, and so corrects for the remaining non-comparability of units of the rescaled data noted above.

These data sources are rescaled and combined to create the six aggregate indicators using a statistical methodology known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM). A key feature of the methodology is that it generates margins of error for each governance estimate. These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. 

Each of the six aggregate WGI measures are constructed by averaging together data from the underlying sources that correspond to the concept of governance being measured.  This is done in the three steps:

STEP 1:  Assigning data from individual sources to the six aggregate indicators.  Individual questions from the underlying data sources are assigned to each of the six aggregate indicators.  For example, a firm survey question on the regulatory environment would be assigned to Regulatory Quality, or a measure of press freedom would be assigned to Voice and Accountability. The individual variables used in the WGI and how they are assigned to the six aggregate indicators, can be found on the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators].  Note that not all of the data sources cover all countries, and so the aggregate governance scores are based on different sets of underlying data for different countries.

STEP 2:  Rescaling of the individual source data to run from 0 to 1.  The questions from the individual data sources are first rescaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.  If, for example, a survey question asks for responses on a scale from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4, we rescale a score of 2 as (2-min)/(max-min)=(2-1)/3=0.33.  When an individual data source provides more than one question relating to a particular dimension of governance, the rescaled scores are averaged together.
The 0-1 rescaled data from the individual sources are available interactively through the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access] and in the data files for each individual source [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/documentation#2].

In such cases the reason(s) for inclusion must be clearly stated. 

Actual expenditure outturns can deviate from the originally approved budget for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of forecasts—for example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock.

Detailed resources are available at www.pefa.org",,"Although not all countries have used the PEFA methodology on an annual basis for the PEFA PI-1 indicator, the methodology relies on standard data sets for approved and final budget outturns which are commonly produced at least annually in every country. The countries that have not used the methodology to date are primarily highly developed countries which would have less difficulty in providing the necessary data than those in the lower and middle income categories that have been primary users of Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) to date.

One limitation of the indicator is that it is an aggregate indicator of budget reliability. While it can be disaggregated across regions, it is not disaggregated across various budget subcomponents. Different indicators are used for assessing changes in expenditure composition in the PEFA framework. Also, while this indicator is intended to measure budget reliability it should be understood that actual expenditure outturns can deviate from the originally approved budget for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of forecasts—for example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock. However, the calibration of this indicator accommodates one unusual or “outlier” year and focuses on deviations from the forecast which occur in two of the three years covered by the assessment. Therefore, single year shocks are discounted allowing a more balanced assessment. 

The broader context in which the indicator was developed is as follows. PEFA is a tool for assessing the status of public financial management and reporting on the strengths and weaknesses of Public Financial Management (PFM). A PEFA assessment provides a thorough, consistent and evidence-based analysis of PFM performance at a specific point in time and can be reapplied in successive assessments to track changes over time. The PEFA framework provides the foundation for evidence-based measurement of countries’ PFM systems using 31 performance indicators that are further disaggregated into 94 dimensions.

(B) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 90% and 110% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years. (C Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 85% and 115% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years. (D) Performance is less than required for a C score. In order to justify a particular score, every aspect specified in the scoring requirements must be fulfilled. 

If the requirements are only partly met, the criteria are not satisfied and a lower score should be given that coincides with achievement of all requirements for the lower performance rating. A score of C reflects the basic level of performance for each indicator and dimension, consistent with good international practices. A score of D means that the feature being measured is present at less than the basic level of performance or is absent altogether, or that there is insufficient information to score the dimension. 

The D score indicates performance that falls below the basic level. ‘D’ is applied if the performance observed is less than required for any higher score. For this reason, a D score is warranted when sufficient information is not available to establish the actual level of performance. A score of D due to insufficient information is distinguished from D scores for low-level performance by the use of an asterisk—that is, D* at the dimension level. The asterisk is not included at the indicator level. 

The coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and requires data for three consecutive years as a basis for assessment. The data would cover the most recent completed fiscal year for which data is available and the two immediately preceding years. 
Statistical concept(s): This indicator measures the extent to which aggregate budget expenditure outturn reflects the amount originally approved, as defined in government budget documentation and fiscal reports. The coverage is budgetary central government and the time period covers every fiscal year for the countries.

Refer to Other notes for more details.","The indicator attempts to capture the reliability of government budgets: do governments spend what they intend to and do they collect what they set out to collect. The ability to implement the enacted budget is an important factor in government’s ability to deliver public services and achieve development objectives. The deviation between approved and actual spending is measured over a 12-month period (the budget year) and may have important implications for macroeconomic stability, public service delivery, and social welfare. A credibly implemented budget has only small deviations from the approved one.  If expenditure is under-executed, beneficiaries may not receive crucial services. Over-executed budgets may result in budget deficits and increased public debt levels and can influence the macroeconomic stability. In both cases, lack of budget credibility undermines the usefulness of the budget process for policy making and implementation and erodes public trust in government.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Components of the HCI such as stunting and test scores are measured only infrequently in some countries, and not at all in others. Other components, like child and adult survival rates, are imprecisely estimated in countries where vital registries are incomplete or non-existent. Data on enrollment rates needed to estimate expected years of school often have many gaps and are reported with significant lags.

The test score harmonization exercise draws on test scores that come from different international testing programs and converts these into common units. However, the age of test takers and the subjects covered vary across testing programs. As a result, harmonized scores may reflect differences in sampling and cohorts participating in tests (Liu and Steiner-Khamsi 2020). Moreover, test scores may not accurately reflect the quality of the whole education system in a country to the extent that tests-takers are not representative of the population of all students.

Ranging between 0 and 1, the index takes the value 1 only if a child born today can expect to achieve full health (de?ned as no stunting and survival up to at least age 60) and achieve her formal education potential (de?ned as 14 years of high-quality school by age 18).



A country’s score is its distance to the “frontier” of complete education and full health. If it scores 0.70 in the Human Capital Index, this indicates that the future earnings potential of children born today will be 70% of what they could have been with complete education and full health.



The index can directly be linked to scenarios for the future income of countries as well as individuals. If a country has a score of 0.50, then future GDP per worker could be twice as high if the country reached the benchmark of complete education and full health.



The index is presented as a country average and includes a breakdown by gender for countries where data is available.

The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. All 16 CPIA criteria contain a detailed description of each rating level. In assessing country performance, World Bank staff evaluate the country's performance on each of the criteria and assign a rating. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments based on country knowledge and on relevant publicly available indicators. In interpreting the assessment scores, it should be noted that the criteria are designed in a developmentally neutral manner. Accordingly, higher scores can be attained by a country that, given its stage of development, has a policy and institutional framework that more strongly fosters growth and poverty reduction.

The country teams that prepare the ratings are very familiar with the country, and their assessments are based on country diagnostic studies prepared by the World Bank or other development organizations and on their own professional judgment. An early consultation is conducted with country authorities to make sure that the assessments are informed by up-to-date information. To ensure that scores are consistent across countries, the process involves two key phases. In the benchmarking phase a small representative sample of countries drawn from all regions is rated. Country teams prepare proposals that are reviewed first at the regional level and then in a Bankwide review process. A similar process is followed to assess the performance of the remaining countries, using the benchmark countries' scores as guideposts. The final ratings are determined following a Bankwide review.

The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. All 16 CPIA criteria contain a detailed description of each rating level. In assessing country performance, World Bank staff evaluate the country's performance on each of the criteria and assign a rating. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments based on country knowledge and on relevant publicly available indicators. In interpreting the assessment scores, it should be noted that the criteria are designed in a developmentally neutral manner. Accordingly, higher scores can be attained by a country that, given its stage of development, has a policy and institutional framework that more strongly fosters growth and poverty reduction.

The country teams that prepare the ratings are very familiar with the country, and their assessments are based on country diagnostic studies prepared by the World Bank or other development organizations and on their own professional judgment. An early consultation is conducted with country authorities to make sure that the assessments are informed by up-to-date information. To ensure that scores are consistent across countries, the process involves two key phases. In the benchmarking phase a small representative sample of countries drawn from all regions is rated. Country teams prepare proposals that are reviewed first at the regional level and then in a Bankwide review process. A similar process is followed to assess the performance of the remaining countries, using the benchmark countries' scores as guideposts. The final ratings are determined following a Bankwide review. The overall numerical IRAI score and the separate criteria scores were first publicly disclosed in June 2006.","The International Development Association (IDA) is the part of the World Bank Group that helps the poorest countries reduce poverty by providing concessional loans and grants for programs aimed at boosting economic growth and improving living conditions. IDA funding helps these countries deal with the complex challenges they face in meeting the Millennium Development Goals.

The World Bank's IDA Resource Allocation Index (IRAI) is based on the results of the annual Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) exercise, which covers the IDA-eligible countries. Country assessments have been carried out annually since the mid-1970s by World Bank staff. Over time the criteria have been revised from a largely macroeconomic focus to include governance aspects and a broader coverage of social and structural dimensions. Country performance is assessed against a set of 16 criteria grouped into four clusters: economic management, structural policies, policies for social inclusion and equity, and public sector management and institutions. IDA resources are allocated to a country on per capita terms based on its IDA country performance rating and, to a limited extent, based on its per capita gross national income.

The Transparency, Accountability, and Corruption in the Public Sector criterion assesses the extent to which the executive, legislators, and other high-level officials can be held accountable for their use of funds, administrative decisions, and results obtained. Accountability is generally enhanced by transparency in decision-making, access to relevant and timely information, public and media scrutiny, and by institutional checks (e.g., inspector general, ombudsman, or independent audit) on the authority of the chief executive. The criterion covers four dimensions: (a) the accountability of the executive and other top officials to effective oversight institutions; (b) access of civil society to timely and reliable information on public affairs and public policies, including fiscal information (on public expenditures, revenues, and large contract awards); (c) state capture by narrow vested interests; and (d) integrity in the management of public resources, including aid and natural resource revenues.",Score [SCORE],Annual,,,Unweighted average,"The scores depend on the level of performance each year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year.

Components of the HCI such as stunting and test scores are measured only infrequently in some countries, and not at all in others. Other components, like child and adult survival rates, are imprecisely estimated in countries where vital registries are incomplete or non-existent. Data on enrollment rates needed to estimate expected years of school often have many gaps and are reported with significant lags. As a result, the HCI for a country may rely on measures that are somewhat dated that do not reflect the most up-to-date state of human capital in a country.



The test score harmonization exercise draws on test scores that come from different international testing programs and converts these into common units. However, the age of test takers and the subjects covered vary across testing programs. As a result, harmonized scores may reflect differences in sampling and cohorts participating in tests (Liu and Steiner-Khamsi 2020). Moreover, test scores may not accurately reflect the quality of the whole education system in a country to the extent that tests-takers are not representative of the population of all students. Reliable measures of the quality of tertiary education do not yet exist, despite the importance of higher education for human capital in a rapidly changing world. The index also does not explicitly capture other important aspect of human capital, such as noncognitive skills, although they may contribute directly and indirectly to human capital formation (see, for example, Lundberg 2018).



One objective of the HCI is to call attention to these data shortcomings and to galvanize action to remedy them. Improving data will take time. In the interim, and recognizing these limitations, the HCI should be interpreted with caution.

Since publicly available information is inadequate for tracking all weapons and other military equipment, SIPRI covers only what it terms major conventional weapons. Data cover the supply of weapons through sales, aid, gifts, and manufacturing licenses; therefore the term arms transfers rather than arms trade is used. SIPRI data also cover weapons supplied to or from rebel forces in an armed conflict as well as arms deliveries for which neither the supplier nor the recipient can be identified with acceptable certainty; these data are available in SIPRI's database.

Data cover major conventional weapons such as aircraft, armored vehicles, artillery, radar systems and other sensors, missiles, and ships designed for military use as well as some major components such as turrets for armored vehicles and engines. Excluded are other military equipment such as most small arms and light weapons, trucks, small artillery, ammunition, support equipment, technology transfers, and other services.

Governance consists of the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. This includes the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them. The WGI measures six dimensions of governance: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. 

Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism measures perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and/or politically-motivated violence, including terrorism.

The WGI are not used by the World Bank Group to allocate resources.",,,"Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Bank (WB), uri: www.govindicators.org","Methodology: The WGI are composite governance indicators based on over 30 underlying data sources. These data sources are rescaled and combined to create the six aggregate indicators using a statistical methodology known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM). A key feature of the methodology is that it generates margins of error for each governance estimate. These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. 

Each of the six aggregate WGI measures are constructed by averaging together data from the underlying sources that correspond to the concept of governance being measured.  This is done in the three steps:

STEP 1:  Assigning data from individual sources to the six aggregate indicators.  Individual questions from the underlying data sources are assigned to each of the six aggregate indicators.  For example, a firm survey question on the regulatory environment would be assigned to Regulatory Quality, or a measure of press freedom would be assigned to Voice and Accountability. The individual variables used in the WGI and how they are assigned to the six aggregate indicators, can be found on the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators].  Note that not all of the data sources cover all countries, and so the aggregate governance scores are based on different sets of underlying data for different countries.

STEP 2:  Rescaling of the individual source data to run from 0 to 1.  The questions from the individual data sources are first rescaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.  If, for example, a survey question asks for responses on a scale from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4, we rescale a score of 2 as (2-min)/(max-min)=(2-1)/3=0.33.  When an individual data source provides more than one question relating to a particular dimension of governance, the rescaled scores are averaged together.
The 0-1 rescaled data from the individual sources are available interactively through the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access] and in the data files for each individual source [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/documentation#2].  Although nominally in the same 0-1 units, this rescaled data is not necessarily comparable across sources.  For example, one data source might use a 0-10 scale but in practice most scores are clustered between 6 and 10, while another data source might also use a 0-10 scale but have responses spread out over the entire range.  While the max-min rescaling above does not correct for this source of non-comparability, the procedure used to construct the aggregate indicators does (see below).

STEP 3:  Using an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) to construct a weighted average of the individual indicators for each source.   A statistical tool known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) is used to make the 0-1 rescaled data comparable across sources, and then to construct a weighted average of the data from each source for each country.  The UCM assumes that the observed data from each source are a linear function of the unobserved level of governance, plus an error term.  This linear function is different for different data sources, and so corrects for the remaining non-comparability of units of the rescaled data noted above.  The resulting estimates of governance are a weighted average of the data from each source, with weights reflecting the pattern of correlation among data sources.

These data sources are rescaled and combined to create the six aggregate indicators using a statistical methodology known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM). A key feature of the methodology is that it generates margins of error for each governance estimate. These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. 

Each of the six aggregate WGI measures are constructed by averaging together data from the underlying sources that correspond to the concept of governance being measured.  This is done in the three steps:

STEP 1:  Assigning data from individual sources to the six aggregate indicators.  Individual questions from the underlying data sources are assigned to each of the six aggregate indicators.  For example, a firm survey question on the regulatory environment would be assigned to Regulatory Quality, or a measure of press freedom would be assigned to Voice and Accountability. The individual variables used in the WGI and how they are assigned to the six aggregate indicators, can be found on the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators].  Note that not all of the data sources cover all countries, and so the aggregate governance scores are based on different sets of underlying data for different countries.

STEP 2:  Rescaling of the individual source data to run from 0 to 1.  The questions from the individual data sources are first rescaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.  If, for example, a survey question asks for responses on a scale from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4, we rescale a score of 2 as (2-min)/(max-min)=(2-1)/3=0.33.  When an individual data source provides more than one question relating to a particular dimension of governance, the rescaled scores are averaged together.
The 0-1 rescaled data from the individual sources are available interactively through the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access] and in the data files for each individual source [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/documentation#2].  Although nominally in the same 0-1 units, this rescaled data is not necessarily comparable across sources.  For example, one data source might use a 0-10 scale but in practice most scores are clustered between 6 and 10, while another data source might also use a 0-10 scale but have responses spread out over the entire range.  While the max-min rescaling above does not correct for this source of non-comparability, the procedure used to construct the aggregate indicators does (see below).

STEP 3:  Using an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) to construct a weighted average of the individual indicators for each source.   A statistical tool known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) is used to make the 0-1 rescaled data comparable across sources, and then to construct a weighted average of the data from each source for each country.  The UCM assumes that the observed data from each source are a linear function of the unobserved level of governance, plus an error term.  This linear function is different for different data sources, and so corrects for the remaining non-comparability of units of the rescaled data noted above.  The resulting estimates of governance are a weighted average of the data from each source, with weights reflecting the pattern of correlation among data sources.

These data sources are rescaled and combined to create the six aggregate indicators using a statistical methodology known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM). A key feature of the methodology is that it generates margins of error for each governance estimate. These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. 

Each of the six aggregate WGI measures are constructed by averaging together data from the underlying sources that correspond to the concept of governance being measured.  This is done in the three steps:

STEP 1:  Assigning data from individual sources to the six aggregate indicators.  Individual questions from the underlying data sources are assigned to each of the six aggregate indicators.  For example, a firm survey question on the regulatory environment would be assigned to Regulatory Quality, or a measure of press freedom would be assigned to Voice and Accountability. The individual variables used in the WGI and how they are assigned to the six aggregate indicators, can be found on the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators].  Note that not all of the data sources cover all countries, and so the aggregate governance scores are based on different sets of underlying data for different countries.

STEP 2:  Rescaling of the individual source data to run from 0 to 1.  The questions from the individual data sources are first rescaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.  If, for example, a survey question asks for responses on a scale from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4, we rescale a score of 2 as (2-min)/(max-min)=(2-1)/3=0.33.  When an individual data source provides more than one question relating to a particular dimension of governance, the rescaled scores are averaged together.
The 0-1 rescaled data from the individual sources are available interactively through the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access] and in the data files for each individual source [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/documentation#2].  Although nominally in the same 0-1 units, this rescaled data is not necessarily comparable across sources.  For example, one data source might use a 0-10 scale but in practice most scores are clustered between 6 and 10, while another data source might also use a 0-10 scale but have responses spread out over the entire range.  While the max-min rescaling above does not correct for this source of non-comparability, the procedure used to construct the aggregate indicators does (see below).

STEP 3:  Using an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) to construct a weighted average of the individual indicators for each source.   A statistical tool known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) is used to make the 0-1 rescaled data comparable across sources, and then to construct a weighted average of the data from each source for each country.  The UCM assumes that the observed data from each source are a linear function of the unobserved level of governance, plus an error term.  This linear function is different for different data sources, and so corrects for the remaining non-comparability of units of the rescaled data noted above.  The resulting estimates of governance are a weighted average of the data from each source, with weights reflecting the pattern of correlation among data sources.

A key feature of the methodology is that it generates margins of error for each governance estimate. These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. 

Each of the six aggregate WGI measures are constructed by averaging together data from the underlying sources that correspond to the concept of governance being measured.  This is done in the three steps:

STEP 1:  Assigning data from individual sources to the six aggregate indicators.  Individual questions from the underlying data sources are assigned to each of the six aggregate indicators.  For example, a firm survey question on the regulatory environment would be assigned to Regulatory Quality, or a measure of press freedom would be assigned to Voice and Accountability. The individual variables used in the WGI and how they are assigned to the six aggregate indicators, can be found on the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators].  Note that not all of the data sources cover all countries, and so the aggregate governance scores are based on different sets of underlying data for different countries.

STEP 2:  Rescaling of the individual source data to run from 0 to 1.  The questions from the individual data sources are first rescaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.  If, for example, a survey question asks for responses on a scale from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4, we rescale a score of 2 as (2-min)/(max-min)=(2-1)/3=0.33.  When an individual data source provides more than one question relating to a particular dimension of governance, the rescaled scores are averaged together.
The 0-1 rescaled data from the individual sources are available interactively through the WGI website [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access] and in the data files for each individual source [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/documentation#2].  Although nominally in the same 0-1 units, this rescaled data is not necessarily comparable across sources.  For example, one data source might use a 0-10 scale but in practice most scores are clustered between 6 and 10, while another data source might also use a 0-10 scale but have responses spread out over the entire range.  While the max-min rescaling above does not correct for this source of non-comparability, the procedure used to construct the aggregate indicators does (see below).

STEP 3:  Using an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) to construct a weighted average of the individual indicators for each source.   A statistical tool known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM) is used to make the 0-1 rescaled data comparable across sources, and then to construct a weighted average of the data from each source for each country.  The UCM assumes that the observed data from each source are a linear function of the unobserved level of governance, plus an error term.  This linear function is different for different data sources, and so corrects for the remaining non-comparability of units of the rescaled data noted above.  The resulting estimates of governance are a weighted average of the data from each source, with weights reflecting the pattern of correlation among data sources.

Expert assessments also are less likely to be affected by respondent reticence, a concern in household and firm surveys where respondents may be unwilling to give candid responses to sensitive questions about corruption or other dimensions of governance, particularly in countries where governance is weak. 

On the other hand, a shortcoming of expert assessments is that they reflect the views of a narrower set of respondents than household or firm surveys. It also is possible that the ratings provided by one expert assessment to some extent reflect the views of other expert assessments, so that each assessment does not bring completely independent information on the underlying governance concept of interest. To guard against this, the WGI do not use expert assessments that are explicitly based on other existing data sources.

The WGI do not reflect the official views of the Natural Resource Governance Institute, the Brookings Institution, the World Bank, its Executive Directors, or the countries they represent. The WGI are not used by the World Bank Group to allocate resources.",,,"Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Bank (WB), uri: www.govindicators.org, note: The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are a product of the staff of the World Bank with external contributions.","Methodology: The WGI are composite governance indicators based on over 30 underlying data sources. These data sources are rescaled and combined to create the six aggregate indicators using a statistical methodology known as an Unobserved Components Model (UCM). The six aggregate indicators are reported in two ways : (1) in their standard normal units, ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5, and (2) in percentile rank terms from 0 to 100, with higher values corresponding to better outcomes.

A key feature of the WGI is that all country scores are accompanied by standard errors. These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. These standard errors reflect the number of sources available for a country and the extent to which these sources agree with each other (with more sources and more agreement leading to smaller standard errors). These standard errors reflect the reality that governance is difficult to measure using any kind of data. In most measures of governance or the investment climate they are however left implicit or ignored altogether. 

Please see more information at: https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/documentation#1
Statistical concept(s): Standard error indicates the precision of the estimate of governance. Larger values of the standard error indicate less precise estimates. A 90 percent confidence interval for the governance estimate is given by the estimate +/- 1.64 times the standard error.","Good governance is essential for development. It helps countries improve economic growth, build human capital, and strengthen social cohesion. Empirical evidence shows a strong causal relationship between better governance and better development outcomes. The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are designed to help researchers and analysts assess broad patterns in perceptions of governance across countries and over time. The WGI cover over 200 countries and territories, measuring six dimensions of governance starting in 1996: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. The aggregate indicators are based on several hundred individual underlying variables, taken from a wide variety of existing data sources. The data reflect the views on governance of survey respondents and public, private, and NGO sector experts worldwide.",,,,CC BY-4.0
VC.BTL.DETH,Public Sector,Battle-related deaths (number of people),,"Battle-related deaths are deaths in battle-related conflicts between warring parties in the conflict dyad (two conflict units that are parties to a conflict). Battle-related deaths refer to those deaths caused by the warring parties that can be directly related to combat. This includes battlefield fighting, guerrilla activities (e.g. hit and-run attacks/ambushes) and all kinds of bombardments of military bases, cities and villages etc. The target for the attacks is either the military forces or representatives for the parties, though there is often substantial collateral damage in the form of civilians being killed in the crossfire, indiscriminate bombings, etc. All fatalities, military as well as civilian, incurred in such situations are counted as battle-related deaths.",Count,Annual,,,Sum,"While the best estimate for battle-related deaths is considered a conservative minimum, the high estimate may still undercount actual fatalities due to unreported events, and users are cautioned that the apparent precision of the numbers does not eliminate underlying uncertainty.",,,"UCDP Battle-related Deaths Dataset , Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), uri: https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/, publisher: Uppsala University","Methodology: The dataset is constructed by automatically filtering and aggregating the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset from the incident level to the conflict/dyad-year level, and then joining this with additional conflict-year data from related UCDP datasets. Source material is gathered in a two-pass system: first, global newswire reporting is reviewed, followed by targeted searches in local and specialized sources such as local media, NGO and IGO reports, field reports, and social media. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage and cross-verification of events. Detailed procedures, including search strategies, are further described in the UCDP GED Codebook.


Statistical concept(s): The UCDP provides three estimates for battle-related deaths (best, low, and high) to account for the uncertainty inherent in conflict reporting. The ""best estimate"" (which is the value available in the World Development Indicators database) aggregates the most reliable numbers for all incidents each year, favoring the lower figure when sources are equally credible. The ""low estimate"" sums the lowest plausible figures, while the ""high estimate"" aggregates the highest plausible numbers, including incidents with uncertain party involvement. All estimates are based on publicly accessible sources and are subject to revision as new information emerges.","Monitoring battle-related deaths is critical for understanding the human cost of conflict and its implications for development. High levels of conflict-related mortality often coincide with displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and disruption of economic activity, which can reverse progress on poverty reduction and human development. Reliable data on conflict intensity inform policy responses aimed at peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance, and post-conflict recovery. They also support global efforts to track progress toward peace and security goals, by providing evidence for interventions that reduce violence and promote stability.",,,,CC BY-4.0

1) Internally displaced persons may be in transit from one place to another, may be in hiding, may be forced toward unhealthy or inhospitable environments, or face other circumstances that make them especially vulnerable.
 
2) The social organization of displaced communities may have been destroyed or damaged by the act of physical displacement; family groups may be separated or disrupted; women may be forced to assume non-traditional roles or face particular vulnerabilities. Internally displaced populations, and especially groups like children, the elderly, or pregnant women, may experience profound psychosocial distress related to displacement.
 
3) Removal from sources of income and livelihood may add to physical and psychosocial vulnerability for displaced people.
 
4) Schooling for children and adolescents may be disrupted.
 
5) Internal displacement to areas where local inhabitants are of different groups or inhospitable may increase risk to internally displaced communities; internally displaced persons may face language barriers during displacement.
 
6) The condition of internal displacement may raise the suspicions of or lead to abuse by armed combatants, or other parties to conflict.
 
7) Internally displaced persons may lack identity documents essential to receiving benefits or legal recognition; in some cases, fearing persecution, displaced persons have sometimes got rid of such documents.
 
8) According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) tens of millions people around the world are displaced every year within their countries by conflict, human rights violations, natural disasters and climate change. Unlike refugees who cross national borders and benefit from an established system of international protection and assistance, those forcibly uprooted within their own countries, by armed conflict, large-scale development projects, systematic violations of human rights, or natural disasters, lack predictable structures of support. Internal displacement has become one of the more pressing humanitarian, human rights and security problems confronting affected countries and the international community at large.
 
Global migration patterns have become increasingly complex in modern times, involving not just refugees, but also millions of economic migrants.

Refugees have to move if they are to save their lives or preserve their freedom. They have no protection from their own state - indeed it is often their own government that is threatening to persecute them.
