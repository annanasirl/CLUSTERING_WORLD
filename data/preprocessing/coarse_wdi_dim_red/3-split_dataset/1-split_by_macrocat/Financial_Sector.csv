It includes more than 14,000 stocks from 25 developed and 24 emerging markets. It is a rules-based index that measures global stock market performance. The index covers all publicly listed equities with float-adjusted market values of US$ 100 million or more and that meet minimum liquidity criteria measured by median daily value traded figures. The S&P Global BMI is made up of the S&P Developed BMI and S&P Emerging BMI.

Both NPLs and total gross loans should be reported at their gross book value, meaning before any deductions for provisions, write-offs, or collateral. Gross loans include all outstanding loans on the balance sheet, including those classified as non-performing. The classification of NPLs should be based on either quantitative criteria (e.g., days past due) or qualitative assessments (e.g., evidence of financial difficulties), following supervisory standards aligned with Basel guidance. Data should be compiled using a consistent consolidation basis, typically the cross-border, cross-sector, domestically incorporated consolidation approach (CBCSDI), to ensure comparability across reporting entities and jurisdictions. 
Statistical concept(s): The Non-performing Loans (NPLs) to Total Gross Loans ratio is a core indicator of asset quality within the banking sector. It measures the proportion of a deposit taker’s loan portfolio that is impaired or at significant risk of default. A loan is classified as non-performing when payments of principal or interest are overdue by 90 days or more, or when it is assessed that full repayment is unlikely without the realization of collateral, even if the loan is not yet past due. Data are submitted by national authorities to the IMF following the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) Compilation Guide.","This indicator serves as a key measure of asset quality within the banking sector. A higher ratio indicates a greater share of impaired loans, which can signal deteriorating credit risk and financial health of lending institutions. Conversely, a lower ratio reflects better asset quality and lower credit risk. Importantly, total gross loans include the full book value of loans before provisioning and do not net out collateral or guarantees.

The data are compiled on a consolidated basis, typically using the cross-border, cross-sector, domestically incorporated consolidation approach (CBCSDI), which includes all relevant financial entities under common control, regardless of location or legal form.
Statistical concept(s): The Tier 1 Capital to Assets ratio is a core financial soundness indicator that assesses the capital adequacy and financial resilience of deposit takers by measuring the proportion of high-quality, loss-absorbing capital relative to their total balance sheet size. Tier 1 capital, often referred to as core capital, comprises components such as common equity, retained earnings, and other instruments that meet Basel criteria for being fully available to cover losses.","The size and mobility of international capital flows make it increasingly important to monitor the strength of financial systems. Robust financial systems can increase economic activity and welfare, but instability can disrupt financial activity and impose widespread costs on the economy. 

Total assets in this context refer to the gross value of all assets on the balance sheet, without deducting for provisions or reserves. By calculating the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets, this indicator provides a non-risk-weighted measure of leverage, offering insight into the overall capital buffer relative to the size of a deposit taker’s balance sheet. A higher ratio indicates a stronger capital position and lower leverage, while a lower ratio may suggest vulnerability in times of financial stress.

Data are compiled from the nominal effective exchange rate index and a cost indicator of relative normalized unit labor costs in manufacturing. For selected other countries the nominal effective exchange rate index is based on manufactured goods and primary products trade with partner or competitor countries. For these countries the real effective exchange rate index is the nominal index adjusted for relative changes in consumer prices; an increase represents an appreciation of the local currency.","In a market-based economy, household, producer, and government choices about resource allocation are influenced by relative prices, including the real exchange rate, real wages, real interest rates, and other prices in the economy. Relative prices also largely reflect these agents' choices. Thus relative prices convey vital information about the interaction of economic agents in an economy and with the rest of the world.",,,,CC BY-4.0

This is intended to provide a tool to track the trend of remittance prices by various policy makers, including measuring progress towards the commitment by the G8 member countries to reduce the cost of remittances by five percentage points over five years (the “5x5 Objective”), as well as the commitment by the G20 member countries to also reduce the global average to 5 percent. The Global Average Total Cost is calculated as the average total cost for sending USD 200 with all remittance service providers (RSPs) worldwide. In other terms, the global average total cost is the simple average of the total cost for sending USD 200 charged by each single RSP included in the RPW database, expressed as the percentage of the amount sent. The regional and national average total costs are calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the Global Average Total Cost. These represent the simple average total cost for sending USD 200 with every single RSP to a specific region of the world (regional), or to a specific country (national). The reference years reflect third quarter data here; for example, data for 2016 refers to data in the third quarter of the year.

Remittance cost is highlighted in Sustainable Development Goal 10. Target 10.c calls for reducing to less than 3 percent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and ensure that in no corridor remittance senders are required to pay more than 5 percent by 2030.",,,,CC BY-4.0
