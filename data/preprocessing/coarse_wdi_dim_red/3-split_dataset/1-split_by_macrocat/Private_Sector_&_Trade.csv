B-READY granular data provide a wealth of information that can be used to guide specific policy reform. These data are presented in the main body of the report and, in more detail, in the Business Ready website through accessible facilities and tools, including economy profiles.  
Based on the data collected, B-READY generates scores for each topic area and potentially a set of aggregate scores. B-READY collects both de jure information and de facto measures. While de jure data are collected from expert consultations, de facto data are collected from both expert consultations and firm surveys.
All data obtained from either experts or firms are collected in raw form and then converted to a score that can be combined with other scores. The objective of the scoring methodology of raw data is to allow for score aggregation that preserves absolute cardinal differences, which can be used to compare across economies and over time (rather than purely ordinal or relative scoring). The granular data produced by the B-READY project are combined to produce a score for each of the ten B-READY topics. Every topic score will be generated by averaging the scores assigned to each of the three pillars (regulatory framework, public services, and efficiency) for that topic.
In addition, to facilitate international benchmarking, these granular data are used to obtain topic-specific pillar scores, topic scores, and overall pillar scores. A topic-specific pillar score is built from the points assigned to sets of indicators, organized in categories by subject matter.

Details about the B-READY methodology are available on the project website: https://www.worldbank.org/en/businessready/methodology#1","Acquiring the physical space where a business will operate is a crucial ingredient of success for many firms, even in the digital age. Getting the right location can influence business access to customers, transportation, labor, and materials, as well as determine taxes, regulations, and environmental commitments they must comply with.

Whether an entrepreneur is leasing or purchasing a commercial property, the regulatory framework and the public services related to acquiring a location can have an impact on how conducive the business environment is for individual firms and the private sector development of an economy.

Firms are more likely to invest in economies with strong property rights in which they are confident that their immovable property investments will be safe. A reliable land administration system, which provides clear information on property ownership, facilitates the development of real estate markets, and supports tenure security. These factors not only provide confidence to the private sector but also indicate the economy’s prospects for economic growth. Transparency in land administration also reduces information asymmetries, which increases market efficiency, further supporting economic development.  

When investors and entrepreneurs acquire a new location for their business, the process often involves licensing requirements for altering a property or changing tenancy. Building-related permits are essential for public safety, strengthening property rights, and contributing to capital formation. Last but not least, transparent and accessible environmental regulations related to building control reduce the regulatory burden on firms by offering clarity on rules and regulations.",,,,CC BY-4.0

All data obtained from either experts or firms are collected in raw form and then converted to a score that can be combined with other scores. The objective of the scoring methodology of raw data is to allow for score aggregation that preserves absolute cardinal differences, which can be used to compare across economies and over time (rather than purely ordinal or relative scoring). The granular data produced by the B-READY project are combined to produce a score for each of the ten B-READY topics. Every topic score will be generated by averaging the scores assigned to each of the three pillars (regulatory framework, public services, and efficiency) for that topic.
In addition, to facilitate international benchmarking, these granular data are used to obtain topic-specific pillar scores, topic scores, and overall pillar scores. A topic-specific pillar score is built from the points assigned to sets of indicators, organized in categories by subject matter. Each score can range from 0 to 100 (where 100 represents the best performance). Within each topic, there are three topic-specific pillars: Regulatory Framework, Public Services, and Operational Efficiency. The average of the three topic-specific pillar scores, in turn, equals the topic score. Each overall pillar score is the average of the corresponding topic-specific pillar scores across the ten B-READY topics.

To facilitate cross-country comparability, the Entrepreneurship Database employs a consistent unit of measurement, source of information, and concept of entrepreneurship that is applicable and available among the diverse sample of participating economies.

The data collection process involves telephone interviews and email correspondence with business registries. The main sources of information for this study are national business registries. In a limited number of cases where the business registry was unable to provide the data – most often due to an absence of digitized registration systems – the Entrepreneurship Database uses other alternatives sources, such as statistical agencies, tax and labor agencies, chambers of commerce, and publicly available data. 
Statistical concept(s): In order to measure entrepreneurship in a way that is universally comparable, the Entrepreneurship Database employs a methodology that can be applied across heterogeneous legal regimes and economic systems. The concept of entrepreneurship can cover a wide range of activities. For the purposes of this project, entrepreneurship is defined as the activities of an individual or a group of individuals aimed at initiating economic enterprise in the formal sector under a legal form of business.

The legal form of business refers to private companies with limited liability. Limited liability companies are those in which the financial liability of the firm’s members is limited to the value of their investment in the company. A limited liability company is a separate legal entity that has its own privileges and liabilities. Although the laws on business registration vary greatly across countries, the approach to legal entities is largely uniform: any business with a unique legal entity (or “corporate personhood”) separate from its owners must be registered.","Entrepreneurial activity is a pillar of economic growth. The Entrepreneurship Database is a critical source of data that facilitates the measurement of entrepreneurial activity across countries and over time. The data also allow for a deeper understanding of the relationship between new firm registration, the regulatory environment, and economic growth.

The data collection process involves telephone interviews and email correspondence with business registries. The main sources of information for this study are national business registries. In a limited number of cases where the business registry was unable to provide the data – most often due to an absence of digitized registration systems – the Entrepreneurship Database uses other alternatives sources, such as statistical agencies, tax and labor agencies, chambers of commerce, and publicly available data. 
Statistical concept(s): In order to measure entrepreneurship in a way that is universally comparable, the Entrepreneurship Database employs a methodology that can be applied across heterogeneous legal regimes and economic systems. The concept of entrepreneurship can cover a wide range of activities. For the purposes of this project, entrepreneurship is defined as the activities of an individual or a group of individuals aimed at initiating economic enterprise in the formal sector under a legal form of business.

The legal form of business refers to private companies with limited liability. Limited liability companies are those in which the financial liability of the firm’s members is limited to the value of their investment in the company. A limited liability company is a separate legal entity that has its own privileges and liabilities. Although the laws on business registration vary greatly across countries, the approach to legal entities is largely uniform: any business with a unique legal entity (or “corporate personhood”) separate from its owners must be registered.","Entrepreneurial activity is a pillar of economic growth. The Entrepreneurship Database is a critical source of data that facilitates the measurement of entrepreneurial activity across countries and over time. The data also allow for a deeper understanding of the relationship between new firm registration, the regulatory environment, and economic growth. Research using the Entrepreneurship Database has shown a significant relationship between the cost of compliance required to start a business and new firm registration.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Statistical concept(s): The sampling methodology of the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey generates sample sizes appropriate to achieve two main objectives: first, to benchmark the business environment of individual economies across the world and across groups of firms within each economy; second, to conduct firm performance analyses focusing on how the business environment affect firm-level outcomes such as productivity, job creation, investment, and growth. 

To achieve both objectives the sampling methodology: (a) generates a sample representative of the non-agricultural, non-extractive formal private economy,  (b) generates large enough sample sizes for selected industries and other groups of firms to conduct statistically robust analyses with a minimum 7.5% precision for 90% confidence intervals of:  (i) Estimates of population proportions (percentages); and (ii) estimates of the mean of log of sales.

The Universe of Inference of the Enterprise Surveys includes the following list, following ISIC, revision 3.1: all manufacturing sectors (group D), construction (group F), services (groups G and H), transport, storage, and communications (group I), and subsector 72 (from Group K). Following ISIC revision 4 the Universe includes: sections C, F, G, H, I, and divisions 61 and 62 of section J.2 Additionally, the Universe of Inference includes all establishments with five or more employees, fully or partially privately owned: one hundred percent government-owned firms, cooperatives, and firms with less than five employees are excluded. 

Enterprise Surveys are stratified by sector of activity, firm size, and geographical location. Stratification by firm size divides the population of firms into 3 strata: small firms (5-19 employees), medium-size firms (20-99 employees), and large firms (100 or more employees); in very large economies a fourth size stratum is added, the top 1% of firms by size. Geographical stratification is defined to reflect the distribution of the non-agricultural economic activity of each country, which in most cases implies covering the main urban centers of the country. Around the world most of the non-agricultural, non-mining economic activity, the ES Universe, is clustered around the main centers of population. 

Stratification by sector of activity depends on the size of the economy as measured by the Gross National Income (GNI). Very small economies (below $20 billion GNI of 2016) are stratified into 2 groups: manufacturing and services with 75 interviews allocated to each group. For small economies, GNI between $20 billion and $30 billion, the universe is stratified into manufacturing, retail, and the rest services. Medium-size economies, GNI between $30 and 100 billion, single-out the 2 most important manufacturing industries and the remaining manufacturing industries are grouped together into a residual stratum, “rest of manufacturing”; retail and “rest of services” provide the final two strata. For large and very large economies, further manufacturing and services subsectors are single-out for stratification preserving the residual categories to complete exhaust the universe. Also, given the size of these economies the minimum sample size per level of stratification of 120 can be augmented to account for potential non-response to financial variables that are key for the computation of productivity.",Unweighted average,,,,"Enterprise Surveys, World Bank (WB), uri: https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/data, note: All surveys were administered using the Enterprise Surveys methodology as outlined in the Methodology page which can be found from www.enterprisesurveys.org.","Methodology: The World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) is a firm-level survey of a representative sample of an economy's private sector.

Surveys are usually carried out in cooperation with business organizations and government agencies promoting job creation and economic growth, but anonymity is never compromised. The mode of data collection is face-to-face interviews (in-person or virtual).

The WBES is answered by business owners and top managers. The survey respondents might sometimes involve accountants and human resource managers to answer some questions.

In some cases, the list of firms is obtained from business associations or marketing databases. In a few cases, the sample frame is created via block enumeration, where the World Bank “manually” constructs a list of eligible firms after 1) partitioning an economy’s cities of major economic activity into clusters and blocks, and 2) randomly selecting a subset of blocks which will then be enumerated. Since 2005-06, the publicly available survey documentation details the source of the sample frame.","The Enterprise Surveys focus on the many factors that shape the business environment. These factors can be accommodating or constraining for firms and play an important role in whether a country will prosper or not. An accommodating business environment is one that encourages firms to operate efficiently. Such conditions strengthen incentives for firms to innovate and to increase productivity—key factors for sustainable development. A more productive private sector, in turn, expands employment and contributes taxes necessary for public investment in health, education, and other services. In contrast, a poor business environment increases the obstacles to conducting business activities and decreases a country’s prospects for reaching its potential in terms of employment, production, and welfare.

Open markets allow firms to expand, raise standards for efficiency on exporters, and enable firms to import low cost supplies. However, trading also forces firms to deal with customs services and trade regulations, obtain export and import licenses, and in some cases, firms also face additional costs due to losses during transport. The Enterprise Surveys collect information on the operational constraints faced by exporters and importers and quantifies the trade activity of firms.

A more productive private sector, in turn, expands employment and contributes taxes necessary for public investment in health, education, and other services. In contrast, a poor business environment increases the obstacles to conducting business activities and decreases a country’s prospects for reaching its potential in terms of employment, production, and welfare.

The Enterprise Surveys provide indicators of how firms finance their operations and of the characteristics of their financial transactions. For example, Enterprise Surveys provide indicators that compare the relative use of various sources to finance investment. Excessive reliance on internal funds is a sign of potentially inefficient financial intermediation. Another set of indicators measures the use of financial markets by individual firms. It presents the percentage of working capital that is financed by external sources to the firm, and a measure of the burden imposed by loan requirements measured by collateral levels relative to the value of the loans. Additional indicators focus on the use of financial services by private firms both on the credit side, by measuring the percentage of firms with bank loans or lines or credit, and on the deposit mobilization side, by measuring the percentage of firms with checking or savings accounts.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Statistical concept(s): The sampling methodology of the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey generates sample sizes appropriate to achieve two main objectives: first, to benchmark the business environment of individual economies across the world and across groups of firms within each economy; second, to conduct firm performance analyses focusing on how the business environment affect firm-level outcomes such as productivity, job creation, investment, and growth. 

To achieve both objectives the sampling methodology: (a) generates a sample representative of the non-agricultural, non-extractive formal private economy,  (b) generates large enough sample sizes for selected industries and other groups of firms to conduct statistically robust analyses with a minimum 7.5% precision for 90% confidence intervals of:  (i) Estimates of population proportions (percentages); and (ii) estimates of the mean of log of sales.

The Universe of Inference of the Enterprise Surveys includes the following list, following ISIC, revision 3.1: all manufacturing sectors (group D), construction (group F), services (groups G and H), transport, storage, and communications (group I), and subsector 72 (from Group K). Following ISIC revision 4 the Universe includes: sections C, F, G, H, I, and divisions 61 and 62 of section J.2 Additionally, the Universe of Inference includes all establishments with five or more employees, fully or partially privately owned: one hundred percent government-owned firms, cooperatives, and firms with less than five employees are excluded. 

Enterprise Surveys are stratified by sector of activity, firm size, and geographical location. Stratification by firm size divides the population of firms into 3 strata: small firms (5-19 employees), medium-size firms (20-99 employees), and large firms (100 or more employees); in very large economies a fourth size stratum is added, the top 1% of firms by size. Geographical stratification is defined to reflect the distribution of the non-agricultural economic activity of each country, which in most cases implies covering the main urban centers of the country. Around the world most of the non-agricultural, non-mining economic activity, the ES Universe, is clustered around the main centers of population. 

Stratification by sector of activity depends on the size of the economy as measured by the Gross National Income (GNI). Very small economies (below $20 billion GNI of 2016) are stratified into 2 groups: manufacturing and services with 75 interviews allocated to each group. For small economies, GNI between $20 billion and $30 billion, the universe is stratified into manufacturing, retail, and the rest services. Medium-size economies, GNI between $30 and 100 billion, single-out the 2 most important manufacturing industries and the remaining manufacturing industries are grouped together into a residual stratum, “rest of manufacturing”; retail and “rest of services” provide the final two strata. For large and very large economies, further manufacturing and services subsectors are single-out for stratification preserving the residual categories to complete exhaust the universe. Also, given the size of these economies the minimum sample size per level of stratification of 120 can be augmented to account for potential non-response to financial variables that are key for the computation of productivity.",Unweighted average,,,,"Enterprise Surveys, World Bank (WB), uri: https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/data","Methodology: The World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) is a firm-level survey of a representative sample of an economy's private sector.

Private contractors conduct the WBES on behalf of the World Bank. Surveys are usually carried out in cooperation with business organizations and government agencies promoting job creation and economic growth, but anonymity is never compromised. The mode of data collection is face-to-face interviews (in-person or virtual).

The WBES is answered by business owners and top managers. The survey respondents might sometimes involve accountants and human resource managers to answer some questions.

Statistical concept(s): The sampling methodology of the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey generates sample sizes appropriate to achieve two main objectives: first, to benchmark the business environment of individual economies across the world and across groups of firms within each economy; second, to conduct firm performance analyses focusing on how the business environment affect firm-level outcomes such as productivity, job creation, investment, and growth. 

To achieve both objectives the sampling methodology: (a) generates a sample representative of the non-agricultural, non-extractive formal private economy,  (b) generates large enough sample sizes for selected industries and other groups of firms to conduct statistically robust analyses with a minimum 7.5% precision for 90% confidence intervals of:  (i) Estimates of population proportions (percentages); and (ii) estimates of the mean of log of sales.

The Universe of Inference of the Enterprise Surveys includes the following list, following ISIC, revision 3.1: all manufacturing sectors (group D), construction (group F), services (groups G and H), transport, storage, and communications (group I), and subsector 72 (from Group K). Following ISIC revision 4 the Universe includes: sections C, F, G, H, I, and divisions 61 and 62 of section J.2 Additionally, the Universe of Inference includes all establishments with five or more employees, fully or partially privately owned: one hundred percent government-owned firms, cooperatives, and firms with less than five employees are excluded. 

Enterprise Surveys are stratified by sector of activity, firm size, and geographical location. Stratification by firm size divides the population of firms into 3 strata: small firms (5-19 employees), medium-size firms (20-99 employees), and large firms (100 or more employees); in very large economies a fourth size stratum is added, the top 1% of firms by size. Geographical stratification is defined to reflect the distribution of the non-agricultural economic activity of each country, which in most cases implies covering the main urban centers of the country. Around the world most of the non-agricultural, non-mining economic activity, the ES Universe, is clustered around the main centers of population. 

Stratification by sector of activity depends on the size of the economy as measured by the Gross National Income (GNI). Very small economies (below $20 billion GNI of 2016) are stratified into 2 groups: manufacturing and services with 75 interviews allocated to each group. For small economies, GNI between $20 billion and $30 billion, the universe is stratified into manufacturing, retail, and the rest services. Medium-size economies, GNI between $30 and 100 billion, single-out the 2 most important manufacturing industries and the remaining manufacturing industries are grouped together into a residual stratum, “rest of manufacturing”; retail and “rest of services” provide the final two strata. For large and very large economies, further manufacturing and services subsectors are single-out for stratification preserving the residual categories to complete exhaust the universe. Also, given the size of these economies the minimum sample size per level of stratification of 120 can be augmented to account for potential non-response to financial variables that are key for the computation of productivity.",Unweighted average,,,,"Enterprise Surveys, World Bank (WB), uri: https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/data","Methodology: The World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) is a firm-level survey of a representative sample of an economy's private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of topics related to the business environment including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, competition, and performance.

Since 2005-2006, the WBES implemented by the Enterprise Analysis Unit follow the Global Methodology. Earlier datasets from differing survey instruments have been matched to a standard instrument for dissemination on the website and data portal. Note that data users should exercise caution when comparing raw data and point estimates between surveys that did and surveys that did not adhere to the WBES Global Methodology.

Private contractors conduct the WBES on behalf of the World Bank. Surveys are usually carried out in cooperation with business organizations and government agencies promoting job creation and economic growth, but anonymity is never compromised. The mode of data collection is face-to-face interviews (in-person or virtual).

The WBES is answered by business owners and top managers. The survey respondents might sometimes involve accountants and human resource managers to answer some questions.

•	Firms that have at least 1% of private ownership.

The standard WBES questionnaire covers over 15 topics, including firm characteristics, gender participation, access to finance, annual sales, among others. See the questionnaire here.
Over 90% of the questions are fact-based, while the remaining 10% assess the respondents’ opinions on obstacles to their firm’s growth and performance.

The WBES uses stratified random sampling, with the following strata:
•	firm size, most frequently: small (5-19 workers), medium (20-99), and large (100+)
•	business sector
•	geographic region within an economy

Ideally, the survey sample frame is derived from the universe of eligible firms obtained from the economy’s statistical office. Sometimes the master list of firms is obtained from other government agencies such as tax or business licensing authorities. In some cases, the list of firms is obtained from business associations or marketing databases. In a few cases, the sample frame is created via block enumeration, where the World Bank “manually” constructs a list of eligible firms after 1) partitioning an economy’s cities of major economic activity into clusters and blocks, and 2) randomly selecting a subset of blocks which will then be enumerated. Since 2005-06, the publicly available survey documentation details the source of the sample frame.","The Enterprise Surveys focus on the many factors that shape the business environment. These factors can be accommodating or constraining for firms and play an important role in whether a country will prosper or not. An accommodating business environment is one that encourages firms to operate efficiently. Such conditions strengthen incentives for firms to innovate and to increase productivity—key factors for sustainable development. A more productive private sector, in turn, expands employment and contributes taxes necessary for public investment in health, education, and other services. In contrast, a poor business environment increases the obstacles to conducting business activities and decreases a country’s prospects for reaching its potential in terms of employment, production, and welfare.

Good economic governance in areas of regulations, permits and licenses are among the fundamental pillars for the creation of a favorable business environment.  

The Enterprise Surveys provide qualitative and quantitative measures of regulations. For example, the Enterprise Surveys approximates the “time tax” imposed by regulations: it measures the time spent by senior management in meetings with public officials. Another indicator, the average number of visits or required meetings with tax officials, measures the average number of tax inspections or meetings with tax inspectors in each year. 

Effective regulations address market failures that inhibit productive investment and reconcile private and public interests. The number of permits and approvals that businesses need to obtain, and the time it takes to obtain them, are expensive and time consuming. The existing legislation of a country also determines the mix of legal forms private firms take and determines the level of protection for investors thus affecting the incentives to invest. Those indicators focus on the efficiency of business licensing and permit services. The indicators evaluate the delays faced when demanding these services.",,,,CC BY-4.0

The Universe of Inference of the Enterprise Surveys includes the following list, following ISIC, revision 3.1: all manufacturing sectors (group D), construction (group F), services (groups G and H), transport, storage, and communications (group I), and subsector 72 (from Group K). Following ISIC revision 4 the Universe includes: sections C, F, G, H, I, and divisions 61 and 62 of section J.2 Additionally, the Universe of Inference includes all establishments with five or more employees, fully or partially privately owned: one hundred percent government-owned firms, cooperatives, and firms with less than five employees are excluded. 

Enterprise Surveys are stratified by sector of activity, firm size, and geographical location. Stratification by firm size divides the population of firms into 3 strata: small firms (5-19 employees), medium-size firms (20-99 employees), and large firms (100 or more employees); in very large economies a fourth size stratum is added, the top 1% of firms by size. Geographical stratification is defined to reflect the distribution of the non-agricultural economic activity of each country, which in most cases implies covering the main urban centers of the country. Around the world most of the non-agricultural, non-mining economic activity, the ES Universe, is clustered around the main centers of population. 

Stratification by sector of activity depends on the size of the economy as measured by the Gross National Income (GNI). Very small economies (below $20 billion GNI of 2016) are stratified into 2 groups: manufacturing and services with 75 interviews allocated to each group. For small economies, GNI between $20 billion and $30 billion, the universe is stratified into manufacturing, retail, and the rest services. Medium-size economies, GNI between $30 and 100 billion, single-out the 2 most important manufacturing industries and the remaining manufacturing industries are grouped together into a residual stratum, “rest of manufacturing”; retail and “rest of services” provide the final two strata. For large and very large economies, further manufacturing and services subsectors are single-out for stratification preserving the residual categories to complete exhaust the universe. Also, given the size of these economies the minimum sample size per level of stratification of 120 can be augmented to account for potential non-response to financial variables that are key for the computation of productivity.",Unweighted average,,,,"Enterprise Surveys, World Bank (WB), uri: https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/data","Methodology: The World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) is a firm-level survey of a representative sample of an economy's private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of topics related to the business environment including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, competition, and performance.

Since 2005-2006, the WBES implemented by the Enterprise Analysis Unit follow the Global Methodology. Earlier datasets from differing survey instruments have been matched to a standard instrument for dissemination on the website and data portal. Note that data users should exercise caution when comparing raw data and point estimates between surveys that did and surveys that did not adhere to the WBES Global Methodology.

Private contractors conduct the WBES on behalf of the World Bank. Surveys are usually carried out in cooperation with business organizations and government agencies promoting job creation and economic growth, but anonymity is never compromised. The mode of data collection is face-to-face interviews (in-person or virtual).

The WBES is answered by business owners and top managers. The survey respondents might sometimes involve accountants and human resource managers to answer some questions.

•	Formal (registered) companies with five or more workers.
•	Firms that have at least 1% of private ownership.

Occasionally, for a few economies, other sectors are included, such as education or health.

The standard WBES questionnaire covers over 15 topics, including firm characteristics, gender participation, access to finance, annual sales, among others. See the questionnaire here.
Over 90% of the questions are fact-based, while the remaining 10% assess the respondents’ opinions on obstacles to their firm’s growth and performance.

The WBES uses stratified random sampling, with the following strata:
•	firm size, most frequently: small (5-19 workers), medium (20-99), and large (100+)
•	business sector
•	geographic region within an economy

Ideally, the survey sample frame is derived from the universe of eligible firms obtained from the economy’s statistical office. Sometimes the master list of firms is obtained from other government agencies such as tax or business licensing authorities. In some cases, the list of firms is obtained from business associations or marketing databases. In a few cases, the sample frame is created via block enumeration, where the World Bank “manually” constructs a list of eligible firms after 1) partitioning an economy’s cities of major economic activity into clusters and blocks, and 2) randomly selecting a subset of blocks which will then be enumerated. Since 2005-06, the publicly available survey documentation details the source of the sample frame.","The Enterprise Surveys focus on the many factors that shape the business environment. These factors can be accommodating or constraining for firms and play an important role in whether a country will prosper or not. An accommodating business environment is one that encourages firms to operate efficiently. Such conditions strengthen incentives for firms to innovate and to increase productivity—key factors for sustainable development. A more productive private sector, in turn, expands employment and contributes taxes necessary for public investment in health, education, and other services. In contrast, a poor business environment increases the obstacles to conducting business activities and decreases a country’s prospects for reaching its potential in terms of employment, production, and welfare.

Taxes play a crucial role in private sector development by providing the necessary public funds to build infrastructure, maintain social services, and create a stable economic environment. Effective tax administration reduces evasion, ensures fairness, and fosters a conducive business climate, thereby encouraging investment and growth in the private sector. 

The Enterprise Surveys provide quantitative and qualitative measures of taxation and its administration. For example, the Enterprise Surveys collects information about the visits from tax officials or requirements to meet them, along with the burden of tax compliance and filing. Furthermore, the Enterprise Surveys provides information about firms’ perception about the taxes and their administration in their respective economy.",,,,CC BY-4.0

A strong infrastructure enhances the competitiveness of an economy and generates a business environment conducive to firm growth and development. Good infrastructure efficiently connects firms to their customers and suppliers, and enables the use of modern production technologies. Conversely, deficiencies in infrastructure create barriers to productive opportunities and increase costs for all firms, from micro enterprises to large multinational corporations.  

The Enterprise Surveys capture the dual challenge of providing a strong infrastructure for electricity, water supply, internet connections, etc., and the development of institutions that effectively provide and maintain public services. These indicators show the extent to which firms are faced with failures in the provision of electricity and the effect of these failures on sales. Inadequate electricity supply can increase costs, disrupt production, and reduce profitability. Additionally, these indicators measure the efficiency of the water supply for the manufacturing sector. Many manufacturing sectors depend on reliable and efficient sources of water for their operations. The indicators can also be used to evaluate the efficiency of infrastructure services by quantifying the delays in obtaining electricity, water, and telephone connections. Service delays impose additional costs on firms and may act as barriers to entry and investment.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Good economic governance in areas of regulations, permits and licenses are among the fundamental pillars for the creation of a favorable business environment.  

The Enterprise Surveys provide qualitative and quantitative measures of regulations. For example, the Enterprise Surveys approximates the “time tax” imposed by regulations: it measures the time spent by senior management in meetings with public officials. Another indicator, the average number of visits or required meetings with tax officials, measures the average number of tax inspections or meetings with tax inspectors in each year. 

Effective regulations address market failures that inhibit productive investment and reconcile private and public interests. The number of permits and approvals that businesses need to obtain, and the time it takes to obtain them, are expensive and time consuming. The existing legislation of a country also determines the mix of legal forms private firms take and determines the level of protection for investors thus affecting the incentives to invest.

Following ISIC revision 4 the Universe includes: sections C, F, G, H, I, and divisions 61 and 62 of section J.2 Additionally, the Universe of Inference includes all establishments with five or more employees, fully or partially privately owned: one hundred percent government-owned firms, cooperatives, and firms with less than five employees are excluded. 

Enterprise Surveys are stratified by sector of activity, firm size, and geographical location. Stratification by firm size divides the population of firms into 3 strata: small firms (5-19 employees), medium-size firms (20-99 employees), and large firms (100 or more employees); in very large economies a fourth size stratum is added, the top 1% of firms by size. Geographical stratification is defined to reflect the distribution of the non-agricultural economic activity of each country, which in most cases implies covering the main urban centers of the country. Around the world most of the non-agricultural, non-mining economic activity, the ES Universe, is clustered around the main centers of population. 

Stratification by sector of activity depends on the size of the economy as measured by the Gross National Income (GNI). Very small economies (below $20 billion GNI of 2016) are stratified into 2 groups: manufacturing and services with 75 interviews allocated to each group. For small economies, GNI between $20 billion and $30 billion, the universe is stratified into manufacturing, retail, and the rest services. Medium-size economies, GNI between $30 and 100 billion, single-out the 2 most important manufacturing industries and the remaining manufacturing industries are grouped together into a residual stratum, “rest of manufacturing”; retail and “rest of services” provide the final two strata. For large and very large economies, further manufacturing and services subsectors are single-out for stratification preserving the residual categories to complete exhaust the universe. Also, given the size of these economies the minimum sample size per level of stratification of 120 can be augmented to account for potential non-response to financial variables that are key for the computation of productivity.",Unweighted average,,,,"Enterprise Surveys, World Bank (WB), uri: https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/data","Methodology: The World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) is a firm-level survey of a representative sample of an economy's private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of topics related to the business environment including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, competition, and performance.

Since 2005-2006, the WBES implemented by the Enterprise Analysis Unit follow the Global Methodology. Earlier datasets from differing survey instruments have been matched to a standard instrument for dissemination on the website and data portal. Note that data users should exercise caution when comparing raw data and point estimates between surveys that did and surveys that did not adhere to the WBES Global Methodology.

Private contractors conduct the WBES on behalf of the World Bank. Surveys are usually carried out in cooperation with business organizations and government agencies promoting job creation and economic growth, but anonymity is never compromised. The mode of data collection is face-to-face interviews (in-person or virtual).

The WBES is answered by business owners and top managers. The survey respondents might sometimes involve accountants and human resource managers to answer some questions.
•	Firms classified with ISIC Rev. 4 codes 10-33, 41-43, 45-47, 49-53, 55-56, 58, 61-62, 69-75, 79, and 95. These are firms in manufacturing, construction, retail, wholesale, hotels, restaurants, transport, storage, communications, professional services, and IT.*
•	Formal (registered) companies with five or more workers.
•	Firms that have at least 1% of private ownership.

Occasionally, for a few economies, other sectors are included, such as education or health.

(Starting from August 2022, the WBES uses ISIC Rev. 4 (instead of Rev.3.1) for categorizing business activity.  Henceforth, businesses under Section M of ISIC Rev. 4, i.e., professional, scientific, and technical activities, became eligible to participate.)

The standard WBES questionnaire covers over 15 topics, including firm characteristics, gender participation, access to finance, annual sales, among others. See the questionnaire here.
Over 90% of the questions are fact-based, while the remaining 10% assess the respondents’ opinions on obstacles to their firm’s growth and performance.

The WBES uses stratified random sampling, with the following strata:
•	firm size, most frequently: small (5-19 workers), medium (20-99), and large (100+)
•	business sector
•	geographic region within an economy

Ideally, the survey sample frame is derived from the universe of eligible firms obtained from the economy’s statistical office. Sometimes the master list of firms is obtained from other government agencies such as tax or business licensing authorities. In some cases, the list of firms is obtained from business associations or marketing databases. In a few cases, the sample frame is created via block enumeration, where the World Bank “manually” constructs a list of eligible firms after 1) partitioning an economy’s cities of major economic activity into clusters and blocks, and 2) randomly selecting a subset of blocks which will then be enumerated. Since 2005-06, the publicly available survey documentation details the source of the sample frame.","The Enterprise Surveys focus on the many factors that shape the business environment. These factors can be accommodating or constraining for firms and play an important role in whether a country will prosper or not. An accommodating business environment is one that encourages firms to operate efficiently. Such conditions strengthen incentives for firms to innovate and to increase productivity—key factors for sustainable development. A more productive private sector, in turn, expands employment and contributes taxes necessary for public investment in health, education, and other services. In contrast, a poor business environment increases the obstacles to conducting business activities and decreases a country’s prospects for reaching its potential in terms of employment, production, and welfare.

Corruption by public officials may present a major administrative and financial burden on firms. Corruption creates an unfavorable business environment by undermining the operational efficiency of firms and raising the costs and risks associated with doing business.

Inefficient regulations constrain firm efficiency as they present opportunities for soliciting bribes where firms are required to make “unofficial” payments to public officials to get things done. In many countries bribes are common and quite high and they add to the bureaucratic costs in obtaining required permits and licenses. They can be a serious impediment for firms’ growth and development.",,,,CC BY-4.0

When conducting a new WBES, maximal effort is expended to re-interview at least half of the firms from the prior WBES. For these panel firms, sampling weights are adjusted to consider the resulting altered probabilities of inclusion in the sample frame.
Statistical concept(s): The sampling methodology of the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey generates sample sizes appropriate to achieve two main objectives: first, to benchmark the business environment of individual economies across the world and across groups of firms within each economy; second, to conduct firm performance analyses focusing on how the business environment affect firm-level outcomes such as productivity, job creation, investment, and growth.

Taxes play a crucial role in private sector development by providing the necessary public funds to build infrastructure, maintain social services, and create a stable economic environment. Effective tax administration reduces evasion, ensures fairness, and fosters a conducive business climate, thereby encouraging investment and growth in the private sector. 

The Enterprise Surveys provide quantitative and qualitative measures of taxation and its administration. For example, the Enterprise Surveys collects information about the visits from tax officials or requirements to meet them, along with the burden of tax compliance and filing. Furthermore, the Enterprise Surveys provides information about firms’ perception about the taxes and their administration in their respective economy.",,,,CC BY-4.0

The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) uses a structured online survey of logistics professionals at multinational freight forwarders and at the main express carriers. The 2012 LPI data are based on the 2011 survey, which was administered to nearly 1,000 respondents at international logistics companies in 143 countries (domestic performance indicators). The international LPI covers 155 countries. The LPI assesses both large companies and small and medium enterprises. Most of the responses are from small and medium enterprises, with large companies (those with 250 employees or more) accounting for roughly 18 percent of responses. The respondents include groups of professionals who are directly involved in day-today operations, from company headquarters and from country offices such as senior executives, area or country managers, and department managers. Many of the respondents are at corporate or regional headquarters or at country branch offices. The rest are at local branch offices or independent firms. The majority of respondents are involved in providing most logistics services as their main line of work such as warehousing and distribution, customer-tailored logistics solutions, courier services, bulk or break bulk cargo transport, and less-than-full container, full-container, or full-trailer load transport. 

For the lead time to export, respondents were asked for quantitative information on their countries' international supply chains by picking choices from a dropdown menu. When a response indicates a single value, the answer is coded as the logarithm of that value. When a response indicates a range, the answer is coded as the logarithm of the midpoint of that range. Country scores are produced by exponentiating the average of responses in logarithms across all respondents for a given country. This method is equivalent to taking a geometric average in levels. Scores for regions, income groups, and LPI quintiles are simple averages of the relevant country scores.","The LPI measures on-the-ground trade logistics performance, helping national leaders, key policymakers, and private sector traders understand the challenges they and their trading partners face in reducing logistical barriers to international commerce.

A useful outcome measure of logistics performance is the time taken to complete trade transactions. The median import lead time for port and airport supply chains, as measured for the LPI, is more than 3.5 times longer in low performing countries than in high-performing countries. The difference is around three times for land supply chains. The association suggests that geographical hurdles, and perhaps internal transport markets, still pose substantial difficulties in many countries. Besides geography and speed en route, another factor in import lead times is the border process. Time can be reduced at all stages of this process, but especially in the clearance of goods on arrival. Countries with low logistics performance need to reform their border management so that they can reduce red tape, excessive and opaque procedural requirements, and physical inspections. Although the time to clear goods through customs is a fairly small fraction of total import time for all LPI quintiles, it rises sharply if goods are physically inspected. Core customs procedures are similar across quintiles. But low-performing countries have a far higher prevalence of physical inspection, even subjecting the same shipment to repeated inspections by multiple agencies.

The components are rated on a scale (lowest score to highest score) from 1 to 5.  The eight countries are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the country where the respondent is located, on random selection, and - for landlocked countries - on neighboring countries that form part of the land bridge connecting them with international markets.  The method used to select the group of countries rated by each respondent varies by the characteristics of the country where the respondent is located. If respondents did not provide information for all six components, interpolation is used to fill in missing values. The missing values are replaced with the country mean response for each question, adjusted by the respondent's average deviation from the country mean in the answered questions.  
Statistical concept(s): The LPI is constructed from the six indicators using principal component analysis (PCA), a standard statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. In the LPI, the inputs for PCA are country scores the questions covering the main six components, averaged across all respondents providing data on a given overseas market. Scores are normalized by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation before conducting PCA. The output from PCA is a single indicator - the LPI - that is a weighted average of those scores. The weights are chosen to maximize the percentage of variation in the LPI's original six indicators. To construct the international LPI, normalized scores for each of the six original indicators are multiplied by their component loadings and then summed. The component loadings represent the weight given to each original indicator in constructing the international LPI. Since the loadings are similar for all six, the international LPI is close to a simple average of the indicators. To account for the sampling error created by the LPI's survey-based dataset, LPI scores are presented with approximate 80 percent confidence intervals.","The LPI measures on-the-ground trade logistics performance, helping national leaders, key policymakers, and private sector traders understand the challenges they and their trading partners face in reducing logistical barriers to international commerce.

Although the World Tourism Organization reports progress in harmonizing definitions and measurement, differences in national practices still prevent full comparability.

Arrivals data measure the flows of international visitors to the country of reference: each arrival corresponds to one in inbound tourism trip. If a person visits several countries during the course of a single trip, his/her arrival in each country is recorded separately. In an accounting period, arrivals are not necessarily equal to the number of persons travelling (when a person visits the same country several times a year, each trip by the same person is counted as a separate arrival).

Arrivals data should correspond to inbound visitors by including both tourists and same-day non-resident visitors. All other types of travelers (such as border, seasonal and other short-term workers, long-term students and others) should be excluded as they do not qualify as visitors.

Data are obtained from different sources: administrative records (immigration, traffic counts, and other possible types of controls), border surveys or a mix of them. If data are obtained from accommodation surveys, the number of guests is used as estimate of arrival figures; consequently, in this case, breakdowns by regions, main purpose of the trip, modes of transport used or forms of organization of the trip are based on complementary visitor surveys.","Tourism is officially recognized as a directly measurable activity, enabling more accurate analysis and more effective policy.

Departures data measure the flows of resident visitors leaving the country of reference. Departures are not necessarily equal to the number of arrivals reported by international destinations for the country of reference.

In many countries, the characteristics of trips and visitors are established through questions on the entry/departure cards, in surveys at the borders, at destination (accommodation surveys) or as part of household surveys (for domestic and outbound tourism). The entry/departure cards, or records of entry and departure, captured and reconciled by the immigration authorities are often the basic source for establishing the flows of inbound and outbound visitors. These cards usually collect information on a census basis on name, sex, age, nationality, current address, date of arrival (or departure in the departure card), purpose of trip, main destination visited and length of stay (expected on arrival and actual on departure for inbound visitors; expected on departure and actual on arrival for outbound visitors).

Data is collected using one of three methods, or a combination of these to determine the flows of outbound visitors: using an entry/departure card; a specific survey at the border, or observing them from household surveys because they belong to resident households.

Disaggregation of important components may be limited and varies considerably across countries. There are inconsistencies in the methods used to report items.

These factors contribute to a downward bias in the value of the service trade reported in the balance of payments.





Efforts are being made to improve the coverage, quality, and consistency of these data. Eurostat and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, for example, are working together to improve the collection of statistics on trade in services in member countries.





Still, difficulties in capturing all the dimensions of international trade in services mean that the record is likely to remain incomplete. Cross-border intrafirm service transactions, which are usually not captured in the balance of payments, have increased in recent years. An example is transnational corporations' use of mainframe computers around the clock for data processing, exploiting time zone differences between their home country and the host countries of their affiliates.

Disaggregation of important components may be limited and varies considerably across countries. There are inconsistencies in the methods used to report items. And the recording of major flows as net items is common (for example, insurance transactions are often recorded as premiums less claims). These factors contribute to a downward bias in the value of the service trade reported in the balance of payments.





Efforts are being made to improve the coverage, quality, and consistency of these data. Eurostat and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, for example, are working together to improve the collection of statistics on trade in services in member countries.





Still, difficulties in capturing all the dimensions of international trade in services mean that the record is likely to remain incomplete. Cross-border intrafirm service transactions, which are usually not captured in the balance of payments, have increased in recent years. An example is transnational corporations' use of mainframe computers around the clock for data processing, exploiting time zone differences between their home country and the host countries of their affiliates. Another important dimension of service trade not captured by conventional balance of payments statistics is establishment trade - sales in the host country by foreign affiliates.

It is calculated as the ratio between the value of goods exported to the specified group and the total value of all merchandise exports of the reporting economy in the same period. All export values are expressed in current U.S. dollars and originate from customs records collected by national authorities.

The destination of merchandise exports is identified through shipping documentation and export declarations, typically using the last known destination country at the time of customs clearance. Classification of partner economies is based on lists reflecting regional membership, development level, or income groupings as used at the time of reporting. For example, high-income economies are defined by income thresholds, while other groups like the Arab World are identified by political-geographic criteria.

Export data are usually reported on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, meaning the value reflects the cost of goods at the point of shipment, excluding insurance and freight beyond the port of departure. The indicator provides a measure of export market concentration and can be used to analyze changes in trade orientation, dependency on particular economic groups, or regional integration strategies. Policymakers, analysts, and trade negotiators may use this metric to monitor shifts in export destinations due to new trade agreements, geopolitical developments, supply chain changes, or shifts in global demand.

For most low- and middle-income economies - especially smaller ones - there is a ""geographic bias"" favoring intraregional trade. Despite the broad trend toward globalization and the reduction of trade barriers, the relative share of intraregional trade increased for most economies between 1999 and 2010. This is due partly to trade-related advantages, such as proximity, lower transport costs, increased knowledge from repeated interaction, and cultural and historical affinity. The direction of trade is also influenced by preferential trade agreements that a country has made with other economies.
