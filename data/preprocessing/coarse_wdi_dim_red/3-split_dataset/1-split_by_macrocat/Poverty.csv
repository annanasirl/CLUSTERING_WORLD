Data for high-income economies are mostly from the Luxembourg Income Study database.","Methodology: International comparisons of poverty estimates entail both conceptual and practical problems. Countries have different definitions of poverty, and consistent comparisons across countries can be difficult. Local poverty lines tend to have higher purchasing power in rich countries, where more generous standards are used, than in poor countries.







Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power parities (PPPs), was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in September 2022, when we adopted $3.00 as the international poverty line using the 2021 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. The $4.20 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines in countries classified as Lower Middle Income. The $8.30 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines in countries classified as Upper Middle Income.







Early editions of World Development Indicators used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2021 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank. The current extreme poverty line is set at $3.00 a day in 2021 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the poverty lines found in 15 of the poorest countries ranked by per capita consumption.

See the Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) for details (www.pip.worldbank.org).,,"Gini coefficients are not unique. It is possible for two different Lorenz curves to give rise to the same Gini coefficient. Furthermore it is possible for the Gini coefficient of a developing country to rise (due to increasing inequality of income) while the number of people in absolute poverty decreases. This is because the Gini coefficient measures relative, not absolute, wealth.







Another limitation of the Gini coefficient is that it is not additive across groups, i.e. the total Gini of a society is not equal to the sum of the Gini's for its sub-groups. Thus, country-level Gini coefficients cannot be aggregated into regional or global Gini's, although a Gini coefficient can be computed for the aggregate.







Because the underlying household surveys differ in methods and types of welfare measures collected, data are not strictly comparable across countries or even across years within a country. Two sources of non-comparability should be noted for distributions of income in particular. First, the surveys can differ in many respects, including whether they use income or consumption expenditure as the living standard indicator. The distribution of income is typically more unequal than the distribution of consumption. In addition, the definitions of income used differ more often among surveys. Consumption is usually a much better welfare indicator, particularly in developing countries. Second, households differ in size (number of members) and in the extent of income sharing among members. And individuals differ in age and consumption needs. Differences among countries in these respects may bias comparisons of distribution. 







World Bank staff have made an effort to ensure that the data are as comparable as possible. Wherever possible, consumption has been used rather than income.

The Gini index provides a convenient summary measure of the degree of inequality. Data on the distribution of income or consumption come from nationally representative household surveys. Where the original data from the household survey were available, they have been used to calculate the income or consumption shares by quintile. Otherwise, shares have been estimated from the best available grouped data.







The distribution data have been adjusted for household size, providing a more consistent measure of per capita income or consumption. 







The year reflects the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year data collection started.
Statistical concept(s): The Gini index is the average of all pairwise absolute differences between individual consumption or income, normalized by twice the mean. More intuitively, the Gini index is the average share of mean consumption or income that needs to be transferred between two randomly selected individuals to achieve equality. A Gini index of 1 represents perfect inequality, in which total consumption or income goes to one individual. A Gini index of 0 indicates represents perfect equality, in which all individuals have the same level of consumption or income.","The World Bank Group's vision of promoting shared prosperity includes a measure that tracks the number of economies with high inequality, defined as those with a Gini index greater than 0.4",,,,CC BY-4.0

This measure is based on the dual-cutoff counting methodology developed by Alkire and Foster (2011). The global MPI is composed of three dimensions (health, education, and living standards) and 10 indicators (nutrition, child mortality, school attendance, years of schooling, electricity, drinking water, sanitation, cooking fuel, housing, and assets). 

The global MPI begins by constructing a deprivation profile for each household and person in it that tracks deprivations in each of the 10 indicators. For example, a household and all people living in it are deprived if any child is stunted or any child or adult for whom data are available is underweight; if any child died in the past five years; if any school-aged child is not attending school up to the age at which he or she would complete class 8 or no household member has completed six years of schooling; or if the household lacks access to electricity, an improved source of drinking water within a 30 minute walk round trip, an improved sanitation facility that is not shared, nonsolid cooking fuel, durable housing materials, and basic assets such as a radio, animal cart, phone, television, computer, refrigerator, bicycle or motorcycle. 

All indicators are equally weighted within each dimension, so the health and education indicators are weighted 1/6 each, and the standard of living indicators are weighted 1/18 each. A person’s deprivation score is the sum of the weighted deprivations she or he experiences. The global MPI identifies people as multidimensionally poor if their deprivation score is 1/3 or higher. 

MPI values are the product of the incidence (H, or the proportion of population who live in multidimensional poverty) and intensity of poverty (A, or the average deprivation score among multidimensionally poor people). MPI = H × A. 

The MPI ranges from 0 to 1, and higher values imply higher poverty. MPI values decline when fewer people are poor or when poor people have fewer deprivations.","The global MPI was developed Sabina Alkire and Maria Emma Santos (2014), in collaboration with the Human Development Report Office (HDRO) at UNDP as an internationally comparable measure of acute poverty. Technically, the global MPI relies on the Alkire-Foster method (2011).

The measure takes inspiration and guidance from other prominent global multidimensional measures, particularly the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Oxford University but differs from them in one important aspect: it includes monetary poverty less than $3.00 per day, the new International Poverty Line at 2021 PPP (Purchasing Power Parity), as one of the dimensions. 



The MPM is composed of six indicators: consumption or income, educational attainment, educational enrollment, drinking water, sanitation, and electricity. These are mapped into three dimensions of well-being: monetary, education, and basic infrastructure services.



The three MPM dimensions are weighted equally, and within each dimension each indicator is also weighted equally. Individuals are considered multidimensionally deprived if they fall short of the threshold in at least one dimension or in a combination of indicators equivalent in weight to a full dimension. In other words, households will be considered poor if they are deprived in indicators whose weight adds up to 1/3 or more. Because the monetary dimension is measured using only one indicator, anyone who is income poor is automatically also poor under the multidimensional poverty measure. 



Summarizing the information on the different deprivations into a single index proves useful in making comparisons across populations and across time. However, any aggregation of indicators into a single index always involves a decision on how each indicator is to be weighted.
Statistical concept(s): The World Bank’s multi-dimensional poverty measure (MPM) summarizes the incidence of multiple dimensions of poverty in a country. It captures the idea that poverty is multi-faceted, including both monetary and non-monetary aspects. It assesses deprivation in three dimensions of well-being (monetary poverty, education, and basic infrastructure) and 6 corresponding indicators (monetary poverty, educational attainment, educational enrollment, access to electricity, access to improved sanitation, access to safe drinking water).","Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries.

A country may have a unique national poverty line or separate poverty lines for rural and urban areas, or for different geographic areas to reflect differences in the cost of living or sometimes to reflect differences in diets and consumption baskets.







Poverty estimates at national poverty lines are computed from household survey data collected from nationally representative samples of households. These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including consumption or income from own production), from which it is possible to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income. 







National poverty lines are the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies. 







Almost all national poverty lines in developing economies are anchored to the cost of a food bundle - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate nutrition for good health and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted for inflation between survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful comparisons of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets change over time, countries periodically recalculate the poverty line based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. 







This series only includes estimates that to the best of our knowledge are reasonably comparable over time for a country. For economies for which the data are from EU-SILC, the reported year is the income reference year, which is the year before the survey year. For all other economies, the year reported is the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year in which data collection started.
Statistical concept(s): National poverty headcount ratio refers to the percentage of a population whose consumption or income per day falls short of the national poverty line. National poverty lines vary by country and over time. In low- and middle-income countries, national poverty lines tend to be absolute poverty lines, thus reflecting the estimated minimum amount of money needed to cover basic needs. In high-income countries, national poverty lines tend to be relative poverty lines, thus reflecting the typical amount of money needed for an individual to afford the typical standard of living and without any restraints to participating fully in the societies in which they live. National poverty lines tend to grow with economic growth, especially in high-income or upper-middle-income countries.","The poverty rate as defined by national poverty lines reflects the share of the population that fails to meet the standard a country thinks is necessary to cover basic needs (typically in low- and middle-income countries) or afford a decent lifestyle (typically in high-income countries).

By this definition, societal poverty represents a combination of extreme poverty, which is fixed in value for everyone, and a relative dimension of well-being that differs in every country depending on the median level of consumption in that country. In countries with low median consumption (less than US$2.00 per person per day), a rise in median consumption does not change the SPL. Indeed, the SPL has the same value as the IPL in all countries with median consumption up to $3.40. However, as countries with median consumption at more than US$3.40 become richer, and the median consumption increases, the value of the SPL also rises. The slope of one-half, the rate at which the SPL is rising as countries become richer, comes from the empirical association observed between national poverty lines and different measures of overall consumption in society. It indicates that, on average, the national poverty lines are increasing at a rate equal to half the median consumption in the countries. The slope of one-half and the intercept of US$1.30 are the values that most closely fit the data provided by the national poverty lines and overall consumption in each country. The SPL and the International Poverty Line (IPL) share the same empirical underpinning. Both are anchored in the distribution of national poverty lines, which represent countries’ own judgements of what poverty means for them. Whereas the IPL focuses narrowly—and deliberately—on the choices of some of the poorest countries, the SPL is built on information from across the whole range of levels of development. In addition to fitting the data well, the slope coefficient of half the median is widely used by many countries and organizations as a measure of relative poverty and inclusion.
Statistical concept(s): Poverty headcount ratio at societal poverty line measures the share of the population living below the societal poverty line. The societal poverty line combines elements of both absolute and relative poverty. A minimum amount of money is required for subsistence (absolute poverty), while an additional amount of money is required to afford the typical lifestyle expected in the society in which people live (relative poverty). The societal poverty line is expressed as: max (US$3.00, US$1.30 + 0.5 median consumption) in 2021 PPP U.S. dollars. $1.30 represents the standard for absolute poverty, while 0.5 median consumption represents the standard for relative poverty. In very poor countries, typically with median consumption up to $3.40, it makes more sense to consider that poverty is entirely absolute, so that the effective societal poverty line becomes the international poverty line of $3.00.","Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries. The first Sustainable Development Goal calls for ending poverty in all forms by 2030. Typically, countries' poverty lines increase in real value as their economies get richer. Essentially, this is because in a richer country it is costlier to participate in society (i.e., be considered non-poor). Yet as relative poverty lines can take on very low values for poor countries, one may want to ensure a lower bound which provides a fixed, absolute element to the SPL, which the study interprets as the cost of consuming some minimum bundle of goods. The Societal Poverty Line tracks poverty rates consistent with these considerations.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Countries have different definitions of poverty, and consistent comparisons across countries can be difficult. Local poverty lines tend to have higher purchasing power in rich countries, where more generous standards are used, than in poor countries.Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power parities (PPPs), was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in September 2022, when we adopted $3.00 as the international poverty line using the 2021 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. The $4.20 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines in countries classified as Lower Middle Income. The $8.30 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines in countries classified as Upper Middle Income.Early editions of World Development Indicators used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2021 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank. The current extreme poverty line is set at $3.00 a day in 2021 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the poverty lines found in 15 of the poorest countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. As a result of revisions in PPP exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in earlier editions.The statistics reported here are based on consumption data or, when unavailable, on income surveys.

The value of $8.30 is the typical poverty line of upper-middle-income countries, which is the estimated minimum amount of money people in upper-middle-income countries need to cover their daily basic needs, including food, clothing, shelter, heath care, education, and so on. The share of population living on less than $8.30 a day is the second indicator the World Bank tracks in its expanded vision indicators to create a world free of poverty in a livable planet. A growing majority of the world’s population live in middle-income countries (for example, about three-quarters in 2024 compared to one-quarter in 1990), so a higher poverty line would be more representative of the word’s current demographic structure.

As a distribution-sensitive measure, the gap narrows when incomes increase anywhere and falls fastest when incomes of the very poorest increase: growth in income of a person earning $3.00 per day gets ten times more weight than growth in income of a person earning $28/day. Improvements (i.e., reductions) in the Prosperity Gap reflect increases in average income, reductions in inequality within countries, and (for global/regional aggregates) reductions in inequality between countries. It is estimated from nationally representative household surveys.

Statistical concept(s): The Prosperity Gap measures the average factor by which everyone’s incomes in a society needs to vary to reach a prosperity standard of $28 per day (expressed in 2021 PPP dollars). Consider the following example of five individuals earning $2, $7, $14, $28, and $56. Their incomes will have to vary by a factor of 14, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5, respectively, to achieve a prosperity standard of $28. If the world consisted of only these five individuals, the Global Prosperity Gap would be the average of these factors (4.3). As shown in this example, poorer individuals contribute more to the Global Prosperity Gap. $28 is roughly the per capita household income at which countries transition from upper-middle-income to high-income status.",The World Bank Group's mission is to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity on a livable planet.
