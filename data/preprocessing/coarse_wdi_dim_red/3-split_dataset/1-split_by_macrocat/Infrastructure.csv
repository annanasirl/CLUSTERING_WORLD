The calculation of this indicator is performed by dividing the total domestic intramural expenditure on research and development (R&D) for a specified year by the gross domestic product (GDP)—which is the aggregate of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy, inclusive of distributive trades and transport, along with product taxes and less any subsidies not included in product values—and then multiplying the quotient by 100.  









Data are collected through national research and experimental development (R&D) surveys, either by the national statistical office or a line ministry (such as the Ministry for Science and Technology).  The data compilers are the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Eurostat (Statistical Office of the European Union) and the Network on Science and Technology Indicators – Ibero-American and Inter-American (RICYT), African Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Indicators Initiative (ASTII) of the African Union Development Agency-NEPAD (AUDA-NEPAD).
Statistical concept(s): The gross domestic expenditure on R&D indicator consists of the total expenditure (current and capital) on R&D by all resident companies, research institutes, university and government laboratories, etc. It excludes R&D expenditures financed by domestic firms but performed abroad. 









The OECD's Frascati Manual defines research and experimental development as ""creative work undertaken on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."" R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.









(1) Basic research - Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view









(2) Applied research - Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge; it is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.









(3) Experimental development - Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on existing knowledge gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those already produced or installed.









The fields of science and technology used to classify R&D according to the Revised Fields of Science and Technology Classification are:




1. Natural sciences;




2. Engineering and technology;




3. Medical and health sciences;




4. Agricultural sciences;




5. Social sciences;




6. Humanities and the arts.









The data are obtained through statistical surveys which are regularly conducted at national level covering R&D performing entities in the private and public sectors.","Science, technology, and innovation constitute pivotal elements for achieving sustainable growth.

Statistical concept(s): Industrial designs are applied to a wide variety of industrial products and handicrafts. They refer to the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of a useful article, including compositions of lines or colors or any three-dimensional forms that give a special appearance to a product or handicraft. The holder of a registered industrial design has exclusive rights against unauthorized copying or imitation of the design by third parties. Industrial design registrations are valid for a limited period. The term of protection is usually 15 years in most jurisdictions. However, differences in legislation exist, notably in China (which provides for a 10-year term from the application date).

Non-resident application refers to an application filed with the IP office of or acting on behalf of a state or jurisdiction in which the first-named applicant in the application is not domiciled. 

Design count: The number of designs contained in an industrial design application or registration. Under the Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs, it is possible for an applicant to obtain protection for up to 100 industrial designs for products belonging to one and the same class by filing a single application. Some national or regional IP offices allow applications to contain more than one design for the same product or within the same class, while others allow only one design per application. In order to capture the differences in application and registration numbers across offices, it is useful to compare their respective application and registration design counts.","The progress and well-being of humanity depend on our capacity to come up with new ideas and creations. Technological progress requires the development and application of new inventions, while a vibrant culture will constantly seek new ways to express itself. 

Intellectual property rights are also vital. Inventors, artists, scientists and businesses put a lot of time, money, energy and thought into developing their innovations and creations. To encourage them to do that, they need the chance to make a fair return on their investment. That means giving them rights to protect their intellectual property. Essentially, intellectual property rights such as copyright, patents and trademarks can be viewed like any other property right. They allow the creators or owners of IP to benefit from their work or from their investment in a creation by giving them control over how their property is used. 

IP rights have long been recognized within various legal systems. For example, patents to protect inventions were granted in Venice as far back as the fifteenth century. Modern initiatives to protect IP through international law started with the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883) and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886). These days, there are more than 25 international treaties on IP administered by WIPO. IP rights are also safeguarded by Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Creativity and inventiveness are vital. They spur economic growth, create new jobs and industries, and enhance the quality and enjoyment of life. The intellectual property system needs to balance the rights and interests of different groups: of creators and consumers; of businesses and their competitors; of high- and low-income countries. An efficient and fair IP system benefits everyone – including ordinary users and consumers.

Some examples: (a) The multibillion-dollar film, recording, publishing and software industries – which bring pleasure to millions of people worldwide – would not thrive without copyright protection.
(b) The patent system rewards researchers and inventors while also ensuring that they share their knowledge by making patent applications publicly available, which helps stimulate more innovation. (c) Trademark protection discourages counterfeiting, so businesses can compete on a level playing field and users can be confident they are buying the genuine article.

Class count: The number of classes specified in a trademark application or registration. In the international trademark system, and at certain national and regional offices, an applicant can file a trademark application specifying one or more of the 45 goods and services classes of the Nice Classification. Offices use either a multi-class or a single filing system. For example, the offices of Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America (US), as well as many European IP offices, have multi-class filing systems. On the other hand, the offices of Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa follow a single-class filing system, requiring a separate application for each class in which an applicant seeks trademark protection. To capture the differences in application and registration numbers across offices, it is useful to compare their respective application and registration class counts.","The progress and well-being of humanity depend on our capacity to come up with new ideas and creations. Technological progress requires the development and application of new inventions, while a vibrant culture will constantly seek new ways to express itself. 

Intellectual property rights are also vital. Inventors, artists, scientists and businesses put a lot of time, money, energy and thought into developing their innovations and creations. To encourage them to do that, they need the chance to make a fair return on their investment. That means giving them rights to protect their intellectual property. Essentially, intellectual property rights such as copyright, patents and trademarks can be viewed like any other property right. They allow the creators or owners of IP to benefit from their work or from their investment in a creation by giving them control over how their property is used. 

IP rights have long been recognized within various legal systems. For example, patents to protect inventions were granted in Venice as far back as the fifteenth century. Modern initiatives to protect IP through international law started with the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883) and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886). These days, there are more than 25 international treaties on IP administered by WIPO. IP rights are also safeguarded by Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Creativity and inventiveness are vital. They spur economic growth, create new jobs and industries, and enhance the quality and enjoyment of life. The intellectual property system needs to balance the rights and interests of different groups: of creators and consumers; of businesses and their competitors; of high- and low-income countries. An efficient and fair IP system benefits everyone – including ordinary users and consumers.

Some examples: (a) The multibillion-dollar film, recording, publishing and software industries – which bring pleasure to millions of people worldwide – would not thrive without copyright protection.
(b) The patent system rewards researchers and inventors while also ensuring that they share their knowledge by making patent applications publicly available, which helps stimulate more innovation. (c) Trademark protection discourages counterfeiting, so businesses can compete on a level playing field and users can be confident they are buying the genuine article.

OECD Statistics, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)","Methodology: Freight traffic on any mode is typically measured in tons and ton-kilometers. A ton-kilometer equals cargo weight transported times distance transported. For railways, an important measure of work performed is gross ton-kilometers, this measure includes rail wagons' empty weight for both empty and loaded movements. This measure of gross ton-kilometers is also called ‘trailing tons' or the total tons being hauled. Sometimes gross ton-kilometer measures include the weight of locomotives used to haul freight trains.

The indicator measures the tonne.kilometers of freight on the national territory of the railway.

The weight taken into account is the actual weight or chargeable weight of the goods carried. Weight means the quantity of goods in thousands of tonnes. The weight to be taken into consideration includes, in addition to the weight of the goods transported, the weight of packaging and the tare weight of containers, swap bodies, pallets as well as road vehicles transported by rail in the course of combined transport operations. If the goods are transported using the services of more than one railway undertaking (e.g. within the group etc.), when possible the weight of goods should not be counted more than once.

The number of tonne-kilometres in millions represents the weight of freight traffic (in millions of tonnes) over the charging distance (in kilometres). 

Statistical concept(s): Tonne-kilometre (tkm) is a unit of measurement of goods transport which represents the transport of one tonne of goods over a distance of one kilometre.

The distance to be covered is the distance actually travelled on the considered network. To avoid double counting each country should count only the tkm performed on its territory. If it is not available, then the distance charged or estimated should be taken into account.","Transport infrastructure - highways, railways, ports and waterways, and airports and air traffic control systems - and the services that flow from it are crucial to the activities of households, producers, and governments.

Economic growth, technological change, and market liberalization affect road transport throughout the world.

Railways have helped in the industrialization process of a country by easy transportation of coal and raw-materials at a cheaper rate. As railways require huge capital outlay, they may give rise to monopolies and work against public interest at large. Even if controlled and managed by the government, lack of competition sometimes results in inefficiency and high costs. Also, many times it is not economical to operate railways in sparsely settled rural areas. Thus, in many developing countries large rural areas have no railway even today.

Rail transport is a major form of passenger and freight transport in many countries. It is ubiquitous in Europe, with an integrated network covering virtually the whole continent. In India, China, South Korea and Japan, many millions use trains as regular transport. In the North America, freight rail transport is widespread and heavily used in for transporting gods. The western Europe region has the highest railway density in the world and has many individual trains which operate through several countries despite technical and organizational differences in each national network. Australia has a generally sparse network, mostly along its densely populated urban centers.

Bulk freight handling is a key advantage for rail transport. Low or even zero transshipment costs combined with energy efficiency and low inventory costs allow trains to handle bulk much cheaper than by road.

OECD Statistics, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)","Methodology: Passenger-kilometers are usually measured on the basis of the rail travel distance between origin and destination multiplied by the number of passengers traveling between each origin and destination. This variable relates to passengers, irrespective of the fare paid and also including free travelling passengers, but excluding members of the train crew. 

The number of passengers should be calculated as number of passenger journeys. A journey is the act of moving from one place (origin) to another (destination) using a given transport mode (e.g. railway). A journey may consist of one or several stages depending on whether one has to change transport means (e.g. using more than one train) in order to get from the origin to the destination. In other words, a journey consists either of a single stage or a sequence of stages using the same transport mode (e.g. railway), following each other in such a way that the destination of one stage coincides with the origin of the next.

Journeys should be considered finished when an overnight stay occurs. For practical purposes, journeys can be considered finished when a change in transport mode or transport company occurs.  

Passenger-kilometers is the total distance travelled by all the passengers. For instance, one person travelling for 20km contributes for 20 passenger-kilometres; four people, travelling for 20km each, contribute for 80 passenger- kilometers

Statistical concept(s): A passenger kilometer is performed when a passenger is carried for one kilometer. Rail passenger-kilometer (pkm) is a unit of measurement representing the transport of one rail passenger by rail over a distance of one kilometer.

The distance to be taken into consideration should be the distance actually travelled by the passenger on the network. To avoid double counting each country should count only the pkm performed on its territory.

Gauge:	N (standard gauge: 1,435 m); L (broad gauge: exact rail gauge inserted); E (narrow gauge: exact rail gauge inserted). The length of railway lines worked is obtained by taking these sections including main-line track listed in the Capital Expenditure Account.

Sections not worked are deducted only in cases where they are permanently out of use, that is, if they are no longer maintained in working order. Lines temporarily out of use continue to form part of the length of lines worked.

The length of a section is measured in the middle of the section, from center to the center of the passenger buildings, or of the corresponding service buildings, of stations which are shown as independent points of departure or arrival for the conveyance of passengers or freight. If the boundary of the rail network falls in open track, the length of the section is measured up to that point.

The section situated between a station approach and the join to the main line of two lines or more which is used by all trains in either direction over these lines, is only counted once. However, if for one or more of these lines, tracks are normally allocated, the length of these lines is counted separately.

If between two stations there are one or more parallel tracks (siding-lines) to the main line, only the length of the latter is counted.

Comparable statistics on access, use, quality, and affordability of ICT are needed to formulate growth-enabling policies for the sector and to monitor and evaluate the sector's impact on development. Although basic access data are available for many countries, in most developing countries little is known about who uses ICT; what they are used for (school, work, business, research, government); and how they affect people and businesses. The global Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development is helping to set standards, harmonize information and communications technology statistics, and build statistical capacity in developing countries. However, despite significant improvements in the developing world, the gap between the ICT haves and have-nots remains.

There are several economic gains associated with broadband. For example, with DSL, users can use a single standard phone line for both voice and data services. This enables them to surf the Internet and call a friend at the same time - all using the same phone line. Broadband also enhances many Internet applications such as new e-government services like electronic tax filing, online health care services, e-learning and increased levels of electronic commerce.

Access to telecommunication services rose on an unprecedented scale over the past two decades. This growth was driven primarily by wireless technologies and liberalization of telecommunications markets, which have enabled faster and less costly network rollout. Access is the key to delivering telecommunications services to people. If the service is not affordable to most people, goals of universal usage will not be met. Over the past decade new financing and technology, along with privatization and market liberalization, have spurred dramatic growth in telecommunications in many countries.

Export values are calculated as gross exports minus re-exports, using country-reported trade statistics. The methodology aggregates the value of exports for all products classified as high-technology according to SITC Rev.4 codes, as defined by Eurostat and the OECD. Periodic updates to product codes and conversion tables (e.g., from HS to SITC) are incorporated to maintain consistency and address data gaps. The indicator is published annually, and methodological adjustments—such as the inclusion of additional product codes to correct for conversion issues—are documented in the metadata to ensure transparency and comparability over time.
Statistical concept(s): High technology products are defined according to SITC Rev.4 as the sum of the following products: Aerospace, Computers-office machines, Electronics-telecommunications, Pharmacy, Scientific instruments, Electrical machinery, Chemistry, Non-electrical machinery, Armament. The following product codes are used: Aerospace: (714 – 71489 -71499)+7921+7922+7924+7925+79291+79293+87411; Computers-office machines: 75194+75195+752+75997; Electronics-communication: 76331+7638+(764-76493-76499)+7722+77261+77318+77625+77627+7763+7764+7768+89844+89846; Pharmacy: 5413+5415+5416+5421+5422; Scientific instruments: 774+871+87211+(874-87411-8742)+88111+88121+88411+88419+(8996-89965-89969); Electrical machinery: (7786-77861-777866-77869)+7787+77884; Chemistry: 52222+52223+52229+52269+525+531+57433+591; Non-electrical machinery: 71489+71499+7187+72847+7311+73131+73135+73142+73144+73151+73153+73161+73163+73165+73312+73314+73316+7359+73733+73735; Armament: 891
The list can also be accessed on the Eurostat website. This list, based on the OECD definition, contains technical products of which the manufacturing involved a high intensity of R&D. The original high-tech products classification is based on SITC Rev. 3 and is taken from Table 4 of Annex 2 of the 1997 working paper of Thomas Hatzichronouglou, OECD. In September 2019 the definition in the World Development Indicators database was updated to SITC Rev.4 from SITC Rev. 3.  The data are in current U.S. dollars and are sourced from the UN's Comtrade database.

Note: The definition of high technology exports in WDI was modified as of October 2024. Specifically the list of SITC Rev.4 high technology product codes now includes product code 776 in its entirety and that all data in its sub-categories is incorporated. This means that products codes 776.11, 776.12, 776.21, 776.23, 776.29 have been added to the high-tech list of products, which does not comply with OECD’s 2008 definition of high-tech.

This change was implemented to address the problem of missing data which occurs during the data conversion process from HS2022 to SITC4. This happens if a country submits export data in the HS2022 coding system and is no longer in HS2017. Specifically, the HS2022-to-SITC4 conversion table (downloaded from COMTRADE) does not break down product code 776.4+ into sub-categories, and the export data of these sub-categories has been subsumed into 776. Since there is no break down for 776.4+, extracting data from the SITC4 dataset in the COMTRADE database will yield zero value for SITC4 codes 776.4, 776.42, 776.44, 776.46, and 776.49 as defined in the OECD high-tech definition. Hence, when calculating high-tech export values using the forward method of summing up data from these five SITC4 codes will result in missing data caused by the conversion process. This can result in a significant year-on-year decline in high-tech export values for affected countries.","High-technology exports represent the value of products with high research and development (R&D) intensity, such as aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and advanced machinery, exported by a country in a given year. High-tech exports are defined according to a standard classification (based on SITC Rev.4, using a product-level approach originally developed by OECD in collaboration with Eurostat), which aggregates product codes associated with high R&D intensity.

From a development perspective, tracking high-technology exports reveals structural shifts in an economy: a rising volume of such exports may signal successful technology transfer, increasing domestic capacity for innovation, and greater economic sophistication. It provides empirical evidence of movement toward higher value-added production, which is often associated with stronger productivity growth, better jobs, improved trade balances, and long-term competitiveness. 

Moreover, by benchmarking across countries, the indicator helps policymakers and researchers assess how well an economy is diversifying away from resource- or low-technology-based exports and embedding itself in segments of global trade characterized by rapid innovation and technological change. Tracking high-technology exports also helps policymakers identify strengths and gaps in national innovation systems, benchmark progress against peers, and design targeted interventions to foster knowledge-intensive industries and diversify export portfolios.",,,,CC BY-4.0

World Integrated Trade Solution system (WITS), World Bank (WB), uri: https://wits.worldbank.org/","Methodology: Data for high-technology exports are sourced from the United Nations Comtrade database and accessed through the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) platform. Export values are calculated as gross exports minus re-exports, using country-reported trade statistics. The methodology aggregates the value of exports for all products classified as high-technology according to SITC Rev.4 codes, as defined by Eurostat and the OECD. Periodic updates to product codes and conversion tables (e.g., from HS to SITC) are incorporated to maintain consistency and address data gaps. The indicator is published annually, and methodological adjustments—such as the inclusion of additional product codes to correct for conversion issues—are documented in the metadata to ensure transparency and comparability over time.
Statistical concept(s): High technology products are defined according to SITC Rev.4 as the sum of the following products: Aerospace, Computers-office machines, Electronics-telecommunications, Pharmacy, Scientific instruments, Electrical machinery, Chemistry, Non-electrical machinery, Armament. The following product codes are used: Aerospace: (714 – 71489 -71499)+7921+7922+7924+7925+79291+79293+87411; Computers-office machines: 75194+75195+752+75997; Electronics-communication: 76331+7638+(764-76493-76499)+7722+77261+77318+77625+77627+7763+7764+7768+89844+89846; Pharmacy: 5413+5415+5416+5421+5422; Scientific instruments: 774+871+87211+(874-87411-8742)+88111+88121+88411+88419+(8996-89965-89969); Electrical machinery: (7786-77861-777866-77869)+7787+77884; Chemistry: 52222+52223+52229+52269+525+531+57433+591; Non-electrical machinery: 71489+71499+7187+72847+7311+73131+73135+73142+73144+73151+73153+73161+73163+73165+73312+73314+73316+7359+73733+73735; Armament: 891
The list can also be accessed on the Eurostat website. This list, based on the OECD definition, contains technical products of which the manufacturing involved a high intensity of R&D. The original high-tech products classification is based on SITC Rev. 3 and is taken from Table 4 of Annex 2 of the 1997 working paper of Thomas Hatzichronouglou, OECD. In September 2019 the definition in the World Development Indicators database was updated to SITC Rev.4 from SITC Rev. 3.  The data are in current U.S. dollars and are sourced from the UN's Comtrade database.

Note: The definition of high technology exports in WDI was modified as of October 2024. Specifically the list of SITC Rev.4 high technology product codes now includes product code 776 in its entirety and that all data in its sub-categories is incorporated. This means that products codes 776.11, 776.12, 776.21, 776.23, 776.29 have been added to the high-tech list of products, which does not comply with OECD’s 2008 definition of high-tech.

This change was implemented to address the problem of missing data which occurs during the data conversion process from HS2022 to SITC4. This happens if a country submits export data in the HS2022 coding system and is no longer in HS2017. Specifically, the HS2022-to-SITC4 conversion table (downloaded from COMTRADE) does not break down product code 776.4+ into sub-categories, and the export data of these sub-categories has been subsumed into 776. Since there is no break down for 776.4+, extracting data from the SITC4 dataset in the COMTRADE database will yield zero value for SITC4 codes 776.4, 776.42, 776.44, 776.46, and 776.49 as defined in the OECD high-tech definition.
