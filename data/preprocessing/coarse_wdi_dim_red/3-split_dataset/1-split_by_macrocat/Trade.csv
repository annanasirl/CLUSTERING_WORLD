LP.LPI.CUST.XQ,Trade,Logistics performance index: Efficiency of customs clearance process (1=low to 5=high),,"Data are from the Logistics Performance Index survey conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. Respondents evaluate eight countries on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The eight countries are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. The 2023 LPI survey was conducted from September 6 to November 5, 2022. It provided 4,090 country assessments by 652 logistics professionals in 115 countries in all World Bank regions. Details of the survey methodology and index construction methodology are included in Appendix 5 of the 2023 LPI report available at: https://lpi.worldbank.org/report. Respondents evaluated efficiency of customs clearance processes (i.e. speed, simplicity and predictability of formalities), on a rating ranging from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Scores are averaged across all respondents.",,Annual,,,Unweighted average,"The Logistics Performance Index is an interactive benchmarking tool created to help countries identify the challenges and opportunities they face in their performance on trade logistics and what they can do to improve their performance. Despite being the most comprehensive data source for country logistics and trade facilitation, the LPI has two important limitations. First, the experience of international freight forwarders might not represent the broader logistics environment in poor countries, which often rely on traditional operators. And the international and traditional operators might differ in their interactions with government agencies - and in their service levels. Second, for landlocked countries and small-island states, the LPI might reflect access problems outside the country assessed, such as transit difficulties. The low rating of a landlocked country might not adequately reflect its trade facilitation efforts, which depend on the workings of complex international transit systems. Landlocked countries cannot eliminate transit inefficiencies with domestic reforms.",,,"Connecting to Compete - Logistics Performance Index (LPI), World Bank (WB), uri: https://lpi.worldbank.org","Methodology: The indicator presents data from Logistics Performance Surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics.  The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) uses a structured online survey of logistics professionals at multinational freight forwarders and the main express carriers. The 2023 International LPI covers 139 countries. Each survey respondent rates eight overseas markets on six core components of logistics performance (the efficiency of customs and border management clearance, the quality of trade and transport infrastructure, the ease of arranging competitively priced shipments, the competence and quality of logistics services, the ability to track and trace consignments, and the frequency shipments reach consignees within scheduled or expected delivery times). The components are rated on a scale (lowest score to highest score) from 1 to 5.  The eight countries are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the country where the respondent is located, on random selection, and - for landlocked countries - on neighboring countries that form part of the land bridge connecting them with international markets.  The method used to select the group of countries rated by each respondent varies by the characteristics of the country where the respondent is located. If respondents did not provide information for all six components, interpolation is used to fill in missing values. The missing values are replaced with the country mean response for each question, adjusted by the respondent's average deviation from the country mean in the answered questions.  
Statistical concept(s): The LPI is constructed from the six indicators using principal component analysis (PCA), a standard statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. In the LPI, the inputs for PCA are country scores the questions covering the main six components, averaged across all respondents providing data on a given overseas market. Scores are normalized by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation before conducting PCA. The output from PCA is a single indicator - the LPI - that is a weighted average of those scores. The weights are chosen to maximize the percentage of variation in the LPI's original six indicators. To construct the international LPI, normalized scores for each of the six original indicators are multiplied by their component loadings and then summed. The component loadings represent the weight given to each original indicator in constructing the international LPI. Since the loadings are similar for all six, the international LPI is close to a simple average of the indicators. To account for the sampling error created by the LPI's survey-based dataset, LPI scores are presented with approximate 80 percent confidence intervals.","The LPI measures on-the-ground trade logistics performance, helping national leaders, key policymakers, and private sector traders understand the challenges they and their trading partners face in reducing logistical barriers to international commerce. As the backbone of international trade, logistics encompasses freight transportation, warehousing, border clearance, payment systems, and many other functions. These functions are performed mostly by private service providers for private traders and owners of goods, but logistics is also important for the public policies of national governments and regional and international organizations. Because global supply chains are so varied and complex, the efficiency of logistics depends on government services, investments, and policies. Building infrastructure, developing a regulatory regime for transport services, and designing and implementing efficient customs clearance procedures are all areas where governments play an important role.  The improvements in global logistics over the past two decades have been driven by innovation and a great increase in global trade. While policies and investments that enable good logistics practices help modernize the best-performing countries, logistics still lags in many developing countries. Indeed, the ""logistics gap"" evident in the first two editions of this report remains.  The importance of logistics performance for economic growth, diversification, and poverty reduction has long been widely recognized. National governments can facilitate trade through investments in both ""hard"" and ""soft"" infrastructure. Countries have improved their logistics performance by implementing strategic and sustained interventions, mobilizing actors across traditional sector silos, and involving the private sector. Logistics is also increasingly important for sustainability. A focus on the environmental impacts of logistics practices is also included in the LPI.",,,,CC BY-4.0
TM.QTY.MRCH.XD.WD,Trade,Import volume index (2015 = 100),,"Import volume indexes are derived from UNCTAD's volume index series and are the ratio of the import value indexes to the corresponding unit value indexes. Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD's estimates using the previous year's trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights.",,Annual,,,,,,,UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),"Methodology: This indicator is constructed as the ratio of the import value index to the corresponding unit value index, both compiled by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The import value index reflects the nominal value of imports over time, while the unit value index serves as a proxy for import prices by capturing changes in average prices per unit. Unit value indexes are based primarily on data reported by national statistical authorities. To ensure data reliability, only values from countries that demonstrate internal consistency and meet quality thresholds defined by UNCTAD are used. Where data are incomplete or fail to meet these standards, UNCTAD supplements them with its own estimates.

The estimation procedure for unit value indexes involves applying trade values from the previous year as weights, using the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) at the three-digit level of aggregation. This method helps to reduce distortions from shifts in trade structure or classification inconsistencies. The resulting indexes are chain-linked to ensure temporal comparability and are rebased to the year 2015 (2015 = 100). The final import volume index allows for the analysis of changes in the physical volume of imports over time, net of price effects, and is particularly useful for assessing trends in trade flows in real terms.",,,,,CC BY-4.0

Removing barriers to merchandise trade could increase growth in these countries - even more if trade in services were also liberalized.

In general, tariffs in high-income countries on imports from developing countries, though low, are twice those collected from other high-income countries. But protection is also an issue for developing countries, which maintain high tariffs on agricultural commodities, labor-intensive manufactures, and other products and services.

Countries use a combination of tariff and nontariff measures to regulate imports. The most common form of tariff is an ad valorem duty, based on the value of the import, but tariffs may also be levied on a specific, or per unit, basis or may combine ad valorem and specific rates. Tariffs may be used to raise fiscal revenues or to protect domestic industries from foreign competition - or both. Nontariff barriers, which limit the quantity of imports of a particular good, include quotas, prohibitions, licensing schemes, export restraint arrangements, and health and quarantine measures. Because of the difficulty of combining nontariff barriers into an aggregate indicator, they are not included in the data.

Some countries set fairly uniform tariff rates across all imports. Others are selective, setting high tariffs to protect favored domestic industries. The effective rate of protection - the degree to which the value added in an industry is protected - may exceed the nominal rate if the tariff system systematically differentiates among imports of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods.",,,,CC BY-4.0

UNCTAD's import value indexes are reported for most economies.,,Annual,,,,,,,UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),"Methodology: The Import Value Index (base year 2015 = 100) captures the movement in the total value of merchandise imports over time, using 2015 as the reference period. This index reflects changes in both the price and quantity of imported goods. An index value above 100 indicates that the total value of imports has increased compared to the base year, while a value below 100 suggests a decline. The indicator is constructed using current-dollar import values, typically sourced from customs data or trade statistics reports. 

Import values are aggregated across all products and trading partners. Because the index combines both price and volume effects, it does not isolate whether changes are due to rising prices, increased quantities, or both. For this reason, it is often interpreted alongside other indicators such as unit value or volume indexes.

Index values are calculated by comparing the nominal value of imports in each year to that of the base year, then scaling the result so that the base year equals 100. This normalization allows for straightforward interpretation and cross-country comparisons. The index is useful for identifying structural shifts in import demand, the impact of currency fluctuations, and the effects of trade policy. It can also be used in macroeconomic modeling to estimate import deflators or as an input for terms-of-trade calculations.",,,,,CC BY-4.0

This index measures the rate at which a country can exchange its exports for imports. A value greater than 100 means the terms of trade have improved relative to the base year, allowing the country to obtain more imports for a given level of exports. Conversely, a value below 100 indicates that the terms have worsened.

Export and import price indexes are derived from unit value data or sampled transaction-level data, depending on country-specific reporting practices. The price indexes may be computed using fixed or chain-weighted methods. To ensure temporal comparability, the export and import series are indexed to a common base year (2015 = 100).

The terms of trade index is sensitive to fluctuations in global commodity prices, exchange rate movements, and changes in trade composition. It is used to assess trade gains or losses, especially for countries reliant on exports of primary commodities. Although it does not capture changes in volumes traded, it provides insight into the relative value received for exports.

By The Export Volume Index (base year 2015 = 100) measures changes in the physical volume of merchandise exports over time, adjusting for price effects. By removing the influence of price changes, this index isolates real growth or contraction in exported quantities. A value above 100 indicates that the volume of exports has increased relative to the base year, while a value below 100 signals a reduction.

To calculate the index, nominal export values are deflated using export price indices or unit value series, depending on the availability of data. These deflated values are then compared to the base year to produce an index that is normalized to 100 in 2015. The index covers all merchandise exports, and values are aggregated at the national level across products and partner economies.

The Export Volume Index helps distinguish between growth due to increased trade activity and growth driven solely by price inflation. It is particularly relevant for monitoring export performance in real terms, analyzing supply chain trends, and identifying structural shifts in trade composition.
