In summary, ASPIRE indicators based on household surveys are useful for:



Benchmarking SPL programs and systems performance in terms of overall coverage, benefit incidence, adequacy of benefits, impact on poverty and inequality, benefit-cost ratios as well as programs overlaps and spending. These indicators are provided by program type, by extreme poor, poor and non-poor, by quintiles of (before and after-transfer) welfare distribution, and by urban/rural geographical areas.
