SE.LPV.PRIM,Education,Learning poverty: Share of Children at the End-of-Primary age below minimum reading proficiency adjusted by Out-of-School Children (%),,"The share of 10-year-olds who cannot read and understand a short passage of age-appropriate material—in other words, those who are below the “minimum proficiency” threshold for reading. This measure is defined as the union of two deprivations: 1) schooling deprivation and 2) learning deprivation. A child is considered schooling-deprived (SD) if he or she is of primary school age and out-of-school. The dimension of learning deprivation (LD) applies only for children in school, and identifies those pupils who are below the minimum proficiency level (MPL) for reading, as defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML), measured in standard learning assessments, and reported in the context of the SDG 4.1.1b monitoring. This “union approach” to measurement reflects the choice that, as presented in the SDGs, all age 10 children must be both in school and learning. The final learning poverty measure combines the two dimensions in a single indicator using the following formula: LP = SD + [(1-SD) x LD]",% of Total,,,,Weighted average,"The construct of “all children reading by age 10” is an ideal that embodies normative statements about both learning and access. To achieve it, not only should all children be reading proficiently after 3 full years in primary education, but they should also have entered school at age 6 or 7. 

By contrast, the actual indicators used to measure learning poverty are based on grade rather than age. Since the assessments are of 4th- through 6th-graders, the children tested will have had at least 3 to 5 years in school to reach what, according to the ideal, should 10 be an age-10 minimum proficiency, or even the entire primary-school-age segment for the out-of-school indicator.

Due to different assessment availability within and between countries, data comparability, both within countries over time and across countries still poses a significant challenge. The additional out of school component further limits comparability.

The learning poverty indicator is based on data covering four-fifths of children at the end of primary school. In other words, a little more than 80 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries live in a country with at least one learning assessment at the end of primary, carried out in the past 9 years. For regional and global aggregates, weighted imputations affect regions with less data coverage. The major gaps are concentrated in countries where the learning crisis is most acute. Less than half of children in Sub-Saharan Africa live in a country with a National Large-Scale Learning Assessment (NLSA) or a international of regional large-scale learning assessment (ILSA or RLSA) of adequate quality to be used for this purpose.

This extensive coverage became possible only in recent years, with the progress in measuring learning in countries and the GAML’s efforts to establish comparability, which has made possible the construction of a global indicator based on harmonized proficiency levels. Future efforts by coalition organizations are also ensuring more flexible assessment options are available for expanding data availability for countries, such as the Assessment of Minimum Proficiency Levels (AMPL) and policy linking exercises led by UIS.",,,"World Bank (WB);
UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), publisher: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)","Methodology: The learning poverty indicator brings together schooling and learning indicators. It starts with the share of children in school who haven’t achieved minimum reading proficiency (Learning Deprived) and adjusts it by the proportion of children who are out of school (Schooling Deprived). 


Formally, Learning Poverty is calculated as: [LD* (1-SD)] + [1 * SD]


where LP = Learning poverty; LD = Learning deprivation or the share of children at the end of primary who read at below the minimum proficiency level, as defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) in the context of the SDG 4.1.1 monitoring; SD = Schooling deprivation or the share of primary-school-age children who are out-of-school (OOS) and in which all OOS are regarded as being below the minimum proficiency level.


Because out-of-school children are treated as non-proficient in reading, learning poverty will always be higher than the share of children in school who haven't achieved minimum reading proficiency. For countries with a very low schooling deprivation, the learning deprivation value will be very close to Learning Poverty. 


Estimating the current level of global and regional learning poverty requires deciding how to define “current.” We include results of assessments within four years before or after a set anchor year. This decision is driven by data availability. International and regional large-scale learning assessments used for SDG 4.1.1b reporting are carried out only every 3 to 4 years. And even where assessments have been carried out recently, there is a lag of a couple of years before the data are available. This band is intended as a moving window. In the original 2019 release, the anchor year used was 2015 (Assessments between 2011 and 2019 are included in the learning poverty estimate). In the 2022 Global Update, the anchor year was moved to 2019 (assessments between 2015 and 2023 are included).


Aggregations for each region comprise the average learning poverty of countries with available data, weighted by their population ages 10–14 years old. To obtain a global estimate, we weight the regional aggregations by the 10–14-year-old population regardless of data availability. This is equivalent to imputing missing country data using regional values.
Statistical concept(s): Minimum Proficiency Level (MPL) in Reading","Ensuring that all students read with comprehension is essential to achieving the ambitious SDG targets and to building human capital. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading. Reading is a gateway to all types of academic learning.  In high-income countries, 90% of all children learn to read with comprehension before the end of primary school, and for the highest-performing countries, the figure reaches 97% or more. Yet past evidence from many low- and middle-income countries has shown that many children are not learning to read with comprehension in primary school. 


The LP indicator illustrates progress toward SDG 4’s broader goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all. It particularly highlights progress towards SDG 4.1.1(b) and SDG 4.1.4, which specifies that all children attend primary school and reach at least a minimum proficiency level in reading at the end of primary. The indicator is also aligned with the World Bank’s Human Capital Project, which aims to ensure that children reach their full potential in school and in life. The ability to read with comprehension is a foundational skill that every education system around the world strives to impart by late in primary school—generally by age 10.

This measure is defined as the union of two deprivations: 1) schooling deprivation and 2) learning deprivation. A child is considered schooling-deprived (SD) if he or she is of primary school age and out-of-school. The dimension of learning deprivation (LD) applies only for children in school, and identifies those pupils who are below the minimum proficiency level (MPL) for reading, as defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML), measured in standard learning assessments, and reported in the context of the SDG 4.1.1b monitoring. This “union approach” to measurement reflects the choice that, as presented in the SDGs, all age 10 children must be both in school and learning. The final learning poverty measure combines the two dimensions in a single indicator using the following formula: LP = SD + [(1-SD) x LD]",% of Total,,,,Weighted average,"The construct of “all children reading by age 10” is an ideal that embodies normative statements about both learning and access. To achieve it, not only should all children be reading proficiently after 3 full years in primary education, but they should also have entered school at age 6 or 7. 

By contrast, the actual indicators used to measure learning poverty are based on grade rather than age. Since the assessments are of 4th- through 6th-graders, the children tested will have had at least 3 to 5 years in school to reach what, according to the ideal, should 10 be an age-10 minimum proficiency, or even the entire primary-school-age segment for the out-of-school indicator.

Due to different assessment availability within and between countries, data comparability, both within countries over time and across countries still poses a significant challenge. The additional out of school component further limits comparability.

The learning poverty indicator is based on data covering four-fifths of children at the end of primary school. In other words, a little more than 80 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries live in a country with at least one learning assessment at the end of primary, carried out in the past 9 years. For regional and global aggregates, weighted imputations affect regions with less data coverage. The major gaps are concentrated in countries where the learning crisis is most acute. Less than half of children in Sub-Saharan Africa live in a country with a National Large-Scale Learning Assessment (NLSA) or a international of regional large-scale learning assessment (ILSA or RLSA) of adequate quality to be used for this purpose.

This extensive coverage became possible only in recent years, with the progress in measuring learning in countries and the GAML’s efforts to establish comparability, which has made possible the construction of a global indicator based on harmonized proficiency levels. Future efforts by coalition organizations are also ensuring more flexible assessment options are available for expanding data availability for countries, such as the Assessment of Minimum Proficiency Levels (AMPL) and policy linking exercises led by UIS.",,,"World Bank (WB);
UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), publisher: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)","Methodology: The learning poverty indicator brings together schooling and learning indicators. It starts with the share of children in school who haven’t achieved minimum reading proficiency (Learning Deprived) and adjusts it by the proportion of children who are out of school (Schooling Deprived). 


Formally, Learning Poverty is calculated as: [LD* (1-SD)] + [1 * SD]


where LP = Learning poverty; LD = Learning deprivation or the share of children at the end of primary who read at below the minimum proficiency level, as defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) in the context of the SDG 4.1.1 monitoring; SD = Schooling deprivation or the share of primary-school-age children who are out-of-school (OOS) and in which all OOS are regarded as being below the minimum proficiency level.


Because out-of-school children are treated as non-proficient in reading, learning poverty will always be higher than the share of children in school who haven't achieved minimum reading proficiency. For countries with a very low schooling deprivation, the learning deprivation value will be very close to Learning Poverty.

where LP = Learning poverty; LD = Learning deprivation or the share of children at the end of primary who read at below the minimum proficiency level, as defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) in the context of the SDG 4.1.1 monitoring; SD = Schooling deprivation or the share of primary-school-age children who are out-of-school (OOS) and in which all OOS are regarded as being below the minimum proficiency level.


Because out-of-school children are treated as non-proficient in reading, learning poverty will always be higher than the share of children in school who haven't achieved minimum reading proficiency. For countries with a very low schooling deprivation, the learning deprivation value will be very close to Learning Poverty. 


Estimating the current level of global and regional learning poverty requires deciding how to define “current.” We include results of assessments within four years before or after a set anchor year. This decision is driven by data availability. International and regional large-scale learning assessments used for SDG 4.1.1b reporting are carried out only every 3 to 4 years. And even where assessments have been carried out recently, there is a lag of a couple of years before the data are available. This band is intended as a moving window. In the original 2019 release, the anchor year used was 2015 (Assessments between 2011 and 2019 are included in the learning poverty estimate). In the 2022 Global Update, the anchor year was moved to 2019 (assessments between 2015 and 2023 are included).


Aggregations for each region comprise the average learning poverty of countries with available data, weighted by their population ages 10–14 years old. To obtain a global estimate, we weight the regional aggregations by the 10–14-year-old population regardless of data availability. This is equivalent to imputing missing country data using regional values.
Statistical concept(s): Minimum Proficiency Level (MPL) in Reading","Ensuring that all students read with comprehension is essential to achieving the ambitious SDG targets and to building human capital. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading. Reading is a gateway to all types of academic learning.  In high-income countries, 90% of all children learn to read with comprehension before the end of primary school, and for the highest-performing countries, the figure reaches 97% or more. Yet past evidence from many low- and middle-income countries has shown that many children are not learning to read with comprehension in primary school. 


The LP indicator illustrates progress toward SDG 4’s broader goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all. It particularly highlights progress towards SDG 4.1.1(b) and SDG 4.1.4, which specifies that all children attend primary school and reach at least a minimum proficiency level in reading at the end of primary. The indicator is also aligned with the World Bank’s Human Capital Project, which aims to ensure that children reach their full potential in school and in life. The ability to read with comprehension is a foundational skill that every education system around the world strives to impart by late in primary school—generally by age 10.

Statistical concept(s): The share of enrollment in private institutions indicates the scale and capacity of private education within a country. A high percentage suggests strong involvement of the non-governmental sector (including religious bodies, other organizations, associations, communities, private enterprises or persons) in providing organized educational programmes. However, in countries where private institutions are substantially subsidized or aided by the government, the distinction between private and public educational institutions may be less clear-cut especially when certain students are directly financed through government scholarships.","The indicator reflects the proportion of students attending private educational institutions. Globally, private schools educate approximately 350 million children, and there has been a notable rise in the prevalence of private institutions (https://world-education-blog.org/2021/12/10/new-2021-2-gem-report-out-today-who-chooses-who-loses/).

Statistical concept(s): This indicator quantifies the proportion of educators within the teaching workforce who have received comprehensive pedagogical training. A high percentage signifies that a substantial majority of students are instructed by teachers equipped with the necessary pedagogical skills and training to teach effectively. The role of teachers is pivotal in upholding the standard of education delivered. Optimal educational outcomes are achieved when all teachers are provided with sufficient, pertinent, and targeted pedagogical training, enabling them to teach at their designated educational level. Moreover, it is crucial that teachers possess the academic qualifications required to competently cover the subject matter they are tasked with teaching.","The percentage of trained educators serves as a barometer for a country's commitment to improving its teaching workforce, and increasing this percentage aligns with the aims of Sustainable Development Goal target 4.c. Female educators, in particular, are vital as they provide inspiration and encouragement for young girls to continue their education. These professionals are instrumental in engaging and maintaining girls' attendance in schools, confronting entrenched gender biases in communities, raising parental aspirations for their daughters, and aiding in the reduction of the educational attainment disparity between male and female students.



















Nonetheless, a surge in student enrollment can lead to a scarcity of qualified teachers.

Statistical concept(s): The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) differentiates between lower secondary education and upper secondary education within its educational programs. ISCED level 2, or  lower secondary education, are designed to build upon the foundational literacy and numeracy skills acquired at ISCED level 1. The objective at this stage is to establish a base for lifelong learning and human development, which can be further enhanced by subsequent educational opportunities. Certain education systems may introduce vocational education programs at this level to equip individuals with skills that are directly applicable to the workforce.

















At ISCED level 3, or upper secondary education, programs are structured to finalize the secondary education phase, preparing students for higher education or to enter the job market with relevant skills, or in some cases, to achieve both objectives.","Secondary education provides children with essential skills that enable their full participation in society.

Statistical concept(s): The share of enrollment in private institutions indicates the scale and capacity of private education within a country. A high percentage suggests strong involvement of the non-governmental sector (including religious bodies, other organizations, associations, communities, private enterprises or persons) in providing organized educational programmes. However, in countries where private institutions are substantially subsidized or aided by the government, the distinction between private and public educational institutions may be less clear-cut especially when certain students are directly financed through government scholarships.","The indicator reflects the proportion of students attending private educational institutions. Globally, private schools educate approximately 350 million children, and there has been a notable rise in the prevalence of private institutions (https://world-education-blog.org/2021/12/10/new-2021-2-gem-report-out-today-who-chooses-who-loses/).

Statistical concept(s): This indicator quantifies the proportion of educators within the teaching workforce who have received comprehensive pedagogical training. A high percentage signifies that a substantial majority of students are instructed by teachers equipped with the necessary pedagogical skills and training to teach effectively. The role of teachers is pivotal in upholding the standard of education delivered. Optimal educational outcomes are achieved when all teachers are provided with sufficient, pertinent, and targeted pedagogical training, enabling them to teach at their designated educational level. Moreover, it is crucial that teachers possess the academic qualifications required to competently cover the subject matter they are tasked with teaching.","The proportion of trained educators is indicative of a nation's dedication to the enhancement of its educational workforce, and the expansion of this metric is a specific objective under Sustainable Development Goal target 4.c. Teachers serve as a crucial asset, particularly for first-generation learners within their families, who depend significantly on educators to gain fundamental literacy skills. Nonetheless, a surge in student enrollment can lead to a scarcity of qualified teachers. The allocation of funds for education plays a vital role in ensuring the proper distribution of teachers, as their salaries constitute a significant portion of educational expenditures. This scarcity of trained educators can lead to the employment of less qualified teachers in more disadvantaged regions.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Statistical concept(s): A greater allocation of government funds towards education reflects a significant emphasis on educational priorities in comparison to other public sector investments. It is important to consider, however, that the capacity of governments to spend varies, resulting in differing budget sizes. Additionally, demographic factors such as the age distribution within a country can influence the proportion of spending on education versus other areas like health or social security.","Investment in education serves as a driving force for economic growth, enhancement of productivity, and the promotion of individual and collective prosperity.

Information pertaining to educational expenditures is sourced from national governments, which provide the data in response to the annual survey conducted by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) or through the joint UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) data collection initiative. The responses to the questionnaire regarding educational spending are typically derived from the annual financial statements issued by either the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Education, or from the national accounts maintained by the National Statistical Office. Additionally, data concerning GDP and overall government expenditure are accessible via the IMF’s World Economic Outlook database, which is updated annually.
Statistical concept(s): Generally, elevated levels of the indicator suggest that a government places a high priority on educational policy. Values ranging from 4% to 6% are indicative of a country achieving the benchmark set forth by the Education 2030 Framework for Action (https://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/education-2030-incheon-framework-for-action-implementation-of-sdg4-2016-en_2.pdf).



















Educational expenditure encompasses spending on fundamental educational goods and services, including teaching personnel, school infrastructure, textbooks, and instructional materials, as well as on ancillary educational goods and services such as support services, general administration, and other related activities.



















Funding for education may originate from public sources, encompassing all government ministries and agencies that finance or support educational programs within the country, as well as from international and private sources, such as household contributions.","Investment in education acts as a driving force for economic growth, enhances productivity, and promotes the betterment of individual and collective welfare.
