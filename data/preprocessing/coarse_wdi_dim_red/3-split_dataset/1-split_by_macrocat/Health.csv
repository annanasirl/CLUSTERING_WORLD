To make neonatal, infant, and child mortality estimates comparable and to ensure consistency across estimates by different agencies, the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), which comprises the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, the United Nations Population Division, and other universities and research institutes, developed and adopted a statistical method that uses all available information to reconcile differences. The method uses statistical models to obtain a best estimate trend line by fitting a country-specific regression model of mortality rates against their reference dates.
Statistical concept(s): The main sources of mortality data are vital registration systems and direct or indirect estimates based on sample surveys or censuses. A ""complete"" vital registration system - covering at least 90 percent of vital events in the population - is the best source of age-specific mortality data.","Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, and adults) and overall mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.",,,,CC BY-4.0

Effective ART suppresses viral load to undetectable levels, preventing progression to AIDS. When viral load remains undetectable, HIV is not sexually transmitted to HIV-negative partners.  

Despite this progress, gaps in treatment persist. Nearly 10 million people living with HIV are not receiving ART, and according to UNAIDS, about half of them reside in Africa. Expanding access to ART remains essential for reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality and for achieving global targets for ending AIDS as a public health threat.

Estimating the Numerator: The number of pregnant women living with HIV receiving antiretrovirals for PMTCT is derived from national program data aggregated from facilities or other service delivery sites and reported by the country.




Estimating the Denominator: The number of pregnant women living with HIV who need antiretroviral medicine for PMTCT is estimated using standardized statistical modeling based on UNAIDS/WHO methods. These methods consider various epidemic and demographic parameters, such as HIV prevalence among women of reproductive age, the effect of HIV on fertility, and national program coverage of antiretroviral therapy. These statistical modeling procedures provide a comprehensive population-based estimate of the number of pregnant women living with HIV who need antiretrovirals for PMTCT in the country.","HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact, blood transfusions, and the sharing of contaminated needles, and it can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Although the number of children acquiring HIV has decreased over time, mother-to-child transmission remains a significant public health concern.

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is critical for reducing new pediatric HIV infections. However, many pregnant and breastfeeding women still do not begin ART or discontinue treatment during this period, contributing to continued transmission risks. Strengthening PMTCT services and ensuring continuity of care are essential for achieving global HIV prevention goals.

In high transmission areas in which the quality of surveillance data does not permit a robust estimate from the number of reported cases, but good data on parasite prevalence is available, the number of cases can be estimated from parasite prevalence. The denominator is estimated, using official UN population and population at risk estimates for countries with sub-national endemicity.

Statistical concept(s): Complete data on malaria cases reported through surveillance systems are the best source of data but are rarely available for large populations at high quality and accuracy. Reported data on malaria cases generally need to be adjusted for extent of health service use (treatment seeking), underreporting and lack of case confirmation (the likelihood that cases are parasite positive). WHO compiles data on reported confirmed cases of malaria and suspected cases tested with microscopy or RDT, submitted by national malaria control programmes. Underreporting is reported or estimated by countries. The extent of health service use (treatment seeking) data were obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health service use.","Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax – pose the greatest threat.",,,,CC BY-4.0

To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).","Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental risks to health.  According to the World Health Organization, the combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about 7 million premature deaths every year.  Most deaths occur due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.

Statistical concept(s): Low birthweight babies are more likely to die during their first month of life and those who survived face lifelong consequences including a higher risk of stunted growth, lower IQ ,and adult-onset chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes.","Low birth-weight, which is associated with maternal malnutrition, raises the risk of infant mortality and stunts growth in infancy and childhood. There is also emerging evidence that low-birth-weight babies are more prone to non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Low birth-weight can arise as a result of a baby being born too soon or too small for gestational age. Babies born prematurely, who are also small for their gestational age, have the worst prognosis.



In low- and middle-income countries low birth-weight stems primarily from poor maternal health and nutrition.

UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), uri: washdata.org, note: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene","Methodology: Utilizing national-level data derived from household surveys, mainly the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the JMP calculates the proportion of the population with access to basic handwashing facilities at home with soap and water for each country by using a simple linear regression.
Statistical concept(s): This indicator is measured using a straightforward indicator that examines the presence of handwashing facilities with soap within homes mainly through national household surveys. 










Collecting accurate information on handwashing practices presents challenges. Self-reported handwashing is an unreliable measure due to the potential for inaccurate reporting. Direct observation of handwashing can lead to observer bias, as individuals may alter their behavior when they know they are being watched, and implementing such observations on a large scale is resource-intensive. A more effective method involves survey enumerators observing the designated handwashing areas in homes and verifying the availability of water and soap, or a local substitute. This approach provides a more dependable and practical measure of handwashing behavior than relying on self-reported data.","Hygiene is closely correlated with human health.   Target 6.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals recognizes that access to facilities allowing good hygiene and sanitation should be universal, and especially important to women and girls, and those in vulnerable situations.   Of the range of hygiene behaviors considered important for health, hand washing with soap and water is a top priority in all settings, and is considered one of the most cost-effective interventions to prevent diarrheal diseases. The availability of a basic handwashing facility is a prerequisite for basic hygiene facilities on premises,  and is a useful proxy for hygienic behavior.",,,,CC BY-4.0

These surveys are administered sporadically, resulting in sparse data for many countries. Furthermore, the trend of the indicators over time is usually not a straight line and varies by country.

Once considered only a high-income economy problem, overweight children have become a growing concern in developing countries. Research shows an association between childhood obesity and a high prevalence of diabetes, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and psychosocial and orthopedic disorders (de Onis and Blössner 2003). Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death, and disability in adulthood. In addition to increased future risks, obese children experience breathing difficulties and increased risk of fractures, hypertension, early markers of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and psychological effects. Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate nutrition before birth and in infancy and early childhood. Many of these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, calorie-dense, micronutrient-poor foods, which tend be lower in cost than more nutritious foods.

Sanitation generally refers to the provision of facilities and services for the safe disposal of human urine and feces. Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease world-wide and improving sanitation is known to have a significant beneficial impact on people's health.

Estimates are modeled estimates produced by the JME. Primary data sources of the anthropometric measurements are national surveys.

This involves calculating the attributable disease deaths by combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure with the prevalence of that exposure in the population. This calculation yields the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which represents the fraction of disease in a population that can be attributed to the exposure, in this case, unsafe WASH.


By applying the PAF to the total deaths from diarrhea or acute respiratory infections, the number of deaths resulting from inadequate WASH can be determined. Additionally, deaths from protein-energy malnutrition attributable to inadequate WASH are estimated by evaluating the impacts of repeated infectious diarrhea episodes on nutritional status, particularly stunting. All deaths from intestinal nematode infections are attributed to inadequate WASH due to their transmission pathway.","Unsafe drinking water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene are important causes of death.  Most diarrheal deaths in the world are caused by unsafe water, sanitation or hygiene.

The discretionary budget is defined as the total household budget, measured by consumption expenditure or income, minus the societal poverty line (SPL  ). Using 2017 purchasing power parities (PPPs), the SPL corresponds to whichever is greater: $2.15 (the international poverty line) or $1.15 + 50% of median household consumption expenditure or income, excluding out-of-pocket household expenditure on health. 



Out-of-pocket health expenditure is defined as any spending incurred by a household when any member uses a health good or service to receive any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, long-term or palliative care); provided by any type of provider; for any type of disease, illness or health condition; in any type of setting (outpatient, inpatient, at home).",Percentage,Annual,,"The proportion of population facing financial hardship due to out-of-pocket health expenditure can be decomposed into two mutually exclusive categories: the proportion of population with impoverishing out-of-pocket health expenditure and the proportion of the population with large but non-impoverishing out-of-pocket health expenditure
(i) Impoverishing out-of-pocket health expenditure
Out-of-pocket health expenditure is defined as impoverishing if it exceeds 100% of household discretionary budget. This is spending that leaves the household with no discretionary budget, or with inability to meet basic needs, once out-of-pocket health expenditure is subtracted from their discretionary budget. For households with negative discretionary budgets (those living in societal poverty), any OOP health spending exceeds 100% of the household discretionary budget.
The proportion of population incurring impoverishing out-of-pocket health expenditure can be further decomposed into the proportion of population further impoverished and the proportion pushed into poverty due to out-of-pocket health expenditure.
Out-of-pocket health expenditure is defined as further impoverishing for households that live in societal poverty (household total consumption or income lies below the societal poverty line) and incur any out-of-pocket health expenditure. 
Out-of-pocket health expenditure is considered as pushing into poverty if households with positive discretionary budgets spend all their discretionary budget on out-of-pocket health expenditure. In other words, household total consumption (or income) is above the societal poverty line, but its total consumption (or income) net of out-of-pocket health expenditure falls below the societal poverty line, pushing the household into societal poverty.
(ii) Large (but not impoverishing out-of-pocket) health spending
Out-of-pocket health spending is defined as large (but non-impoverishing) if it exceeds 40% but remains below 100% of household discretionary budget. This implies ability to meet basic needs but a substantial reduction in ability to consume other goods and services due to the need to pay for health care.",Weighted average,,,,"Universal Health Coverage Dataset, World Health Organization (WHO) [WHO];
World Bank (WB) [WB], note: Universal Health Coverage Dataset","Methodology: Proportion of population facing financial hardship due to out-of-pocket health expenditure (%) is measured as the population-weighted average of the number of people living in households with out-of-pocket household expenditure on health exceeding 40% of household discretionary budget.
Statistical concept(s): The household discretionary budget is defined as total household consumption expenditure or income minus the societal poverty line (SPL). Using 2017 purchasing power parities (PPPs), the SPL corresponds to whichever is greater: $2.15 (the international poverty line) or $1.15 + 50% of median household consumption expenditure or income, excluding out-of-pocket household expenditure on health. Households living in societal poverty, have a negative discretionary budget.
Out-of-pocket health expenditure is defined as any spending incurred by a household when any member uses a health good or service to receive any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, long-term or palliative care); provided by any type of provider; for any type of disease, illness or health condition; in any type of setting (outpatient, inpatient, at home). This excludes any reimbursement by a third party, such as the government, a health insurance fund or a private insurance company. Refer to Other notes for details on out-of-pocket health expenditure.
The recommended data sources for monitoring this indicator are household budget surveys and household income and expenditure surveys, which provide information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures, and are routinely conducted by National Statistical Offices (NSOs). Preference is given for the use of consumption expenditure as a measure or household budget and discretionary budget, with income being used when consumption expenditure data is unavailable. 
To compute regional and global aggregates for a common reference year, survey-based country estimates are first “lined-up” using a combination of interpolation/extrapolation (when there are at least two survey-based estimates available within 5 years around the reference year); econometric modelling (one survey-based estimate available around the reference year); and imputation based on income group medians (no survey-based estimates available around the reference year) (see also SDG 3.8.2 metadata description  (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-08-02.pdf), sections 4.f and 4.g).","Financial hardship due to out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending reflects the extent to which people’s direct health payments reduce their living standards.

For most indicators, this scale is the natural scale of measurement, e.g., the percentage of infants who have been immunized ranges from 0 to 100 percent. However, for a few indicators, conversion and/or rescaling is required to obtain appropriate values from 0 to 100. Once all tracer indicator values are on a scale of 0 to 100, weighted geometric means are computed within each of the four health service areas, and then a geometric mean is taken of those four values. Each tracer is weighted on an indicator specific population based on the denominator of the indicator using United Nations population estimates where applicable. 
Many of the tracer indicators of health service coverage are measured by household surveys.

If soil is deficient in iodine, then so are the plants grown in it, including the grains and vegetables that people and animals consume. There are almost no countries in the world where iodine deficiency has not been a public health problem. Many newborns in low- and middle-income countries remain unprotected from the lifelong consequences of brain damage associated with iodine deficiency disorders, which affect a child's ability to learn and to earn a living as an adult, and in turn prevents children, communities, and countries from fulfilling their potential (UNICEF, www.childinfo.org).

Thus, it is crucially important that pregnant women and young children in particular get adequate levels of iodine.

IDD can easily be prevented at low cost, however, with small quantities of iodine.

Errors and undercounting in census occur even in high-income countries.  In developing countries errors may be substantial because of limits in the transport, communications, and other resources required to conduct and analyze a full census.



The quality and reliability of official demographic data are also affected by public trust in the government, government commitment to full and accurate enumeration, confidentiality and protection against misuse of census data, and census agencies' independence from political influence. Moreover, comparability of population indicators is limited by differences in the concepts, definitions, collection procedures, and estimation methods used by national statistical agencies and other organizations that collect the data.



The currentness of a census and the availability of complementary data from surveys or registration systems are objective ways to judge demographic data quality. Some European countries' registration systems offer complete information on population in the absence of a census.



The United Nations Statistics Division monitors the completeness of vital registration systems. Some developing countries have made progress over the last 60 years, but others still have deficiencies in civil registration systems.



International migration is the only other factor besides birth and death rates that directly determines a country's population change. Estimating migration is difficult. At any time many people are located outside their home country as tourists, workers, or refugees or for other reasons. Standards for the duration and purpose of international moves that qualify as migration vary, and estimates require information on flows into and out of countries that is difficult to collect.



One of the major data sources of this indicator is UN Population Division's World Population Prospects, which use the cohort component method to produce population estimates and projections.



Population projections, starting from a base year are projected forward using assumptions of mortality, fertility, and migration by age and sex through 2050, based on the UN Population Division's World Population Prospects database medium variant.
Statistical concept(s): Estimates of total population describe the size of total population.

The numerator of completeness of birth registration includes children whose birth certificate was seen by the interviewer or whose mother or caretaker says the birth has been registered.,,Annual,,This is the Sustainable Development Goal indicator 16.9.1 [https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/].,Weighted average,"Data on the prevalence of birth registration is collected mainly through censuses, civil registration systems (CRVS) and household surveys. Civil registration systems that are functioning effectively compile vital statistics that are used to compare the estimated total number of births in a country with the absolute number of registered births during a given period. However, the systematic recording of births in many countries remains a serious challenge. In the absence of reliable administrative data, household surveys have become a key source of data to monitor levels and trends in birth registration. In most low- and middle-income countries, such surveys represent the sole source of this information.



Substantial differences can exist between CRVS coverage and birth registration levels as captured by household surveys. The differences are primarily because data from CRVS typically refer to the percentage of all births that have been registered (often within a specific timeframe) whereas household surveys often represent the percentage of children under age five whose births are registered. The latter (the level of registration among children under 5) is specified in the SDG indicator (16.9).",,,"Household surveys, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), note: Household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Largely compiled by UNICEF.","Methodology: Birth registration refers to the permanent and official recording of a child's existence by some administrative levels of the State that is normally coordinated by a particular branch of the government.



Birth registration estimates are primarily drawn from nationally representative household surveys such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Other data sources include other national surveys, censuses and vital statistics from civil registration systems, and estimated coverage of birth registration within national civil registration systems from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).","Society typically first acknowledges a child’s existence and identity through birth registration. The right to be recognized as a person before the law is a critical step in ensuring lifelong protection and is a prerequisite for exercising all other rights. A birth certificate, issued following birth registration, is an important identity document for children. Birth registration also serves a statistical purpose. Universal birth registration is an essential part of a system of vital statistics, which tracks the major milestones in a person’s life - from birth to marriage and death. Such data are essential for planning and implementing development policies and programs, particularly in health, education, housing, water and sanitation, employment, agriculture and industrial production.
